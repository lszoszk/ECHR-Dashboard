#### **Executive summary**

 This report is the eighth report submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, Mr. Abid Hussain, whose mandate was established by the Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 1993/45. The report is submitted pursuant to Commission resolution 1999/36. The report describes the activities undertaken by the Special Rapporteur and contains a discussion of pressing issues, a brief summary of urgent appeals and communications to and from the Governments, as well as the Special Rapporteurís conclusions and recommendations. With regard to the situation in countries, the Special Rapporteur has sent 16 allegations and 111 urgent actions during the year. It is significant to note that the Special Rapporteur has increasingly joined with other thematic mechanisms (the Special Rapporteur on torture, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Chairman of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women and the Special Rapporteur on education).

 During the year under review, the Special Rapporteur has increased cooperation with other United Nations agencies, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations. He has attended the Commonwealth Press Union biennial conference in Barbados (31 October-3 November 2000), a round table discussion on ìThe protection of journalists in conflict zonesî in Germany (6 November 2000) and a seminar on ìInformation for democracyî in Peru (14-16 November 2000). Moreover, his close cooperation with UNESCO continued and increased collaboration was obtained with the OAS Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression and the OSCE Representative on freedom of the media.

 Country visits are an essential aspect of the mandate. From 29 May to 2 June 2000, the Special Rapporteur undertook a mission to Albania. He has received invitations from the Governments of Egypt, Argentina and Peru and hopes to visit these countries in the course of 2001. He has requested invitations from the Governments of Angola, China, Colombia, Cuba, Equatorial Guinea, the Democratic Peopleís Republic of Korea, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Russian Federation, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam to visit their countries, but he regrets that invitations from them have not so far been received.

 On the basis of the communications received (more than 1,700 annually from a variety of sources), the report identifies ìtrendsî that may encourage Governments to review practices and take remedial action when required. The Special Rapporteur also directs the attention of Governments to a number of issues of concern, urging them to review their approach to new technologies and to the right to freedom of opinion and expression of women. Concerns related to increasing violations committed by non-State actors are also raised.

 The Special Rapporteur concludes the report with his recommendations. As the right to freedom of opinion and expression is violated regularly in States with widely different political and institutional frameworks, he urges Governments to scrutinize their domestic legal systems to bring them into line with international standards. The Special Rapporteur also encourages Governments to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, to amend criminal laws which may be used to infringe article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and to ensure

that press offences are no longer punishable by imprisonment. In addition, the Special Rapporteur draws the attention of the Commission on Human Rights to the increasing implication of non-State individuals and entities in violations of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and to the need for a coherent approach in this regard. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur encourages Governments to reduce the gap between the technologically advanced countries and others. The Special Rapporteur continues to express concern at the continuing silencing of women and calls upon Governments to comply with Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), in which the Council urged States to ensure increased representation of women at all decision-making levels in national, regional and international institutions and mechanisms for the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts. Finally, the Special Rapporteur calls on Governments, NGOs and other specialized organizations to provide him with information relating to the issue of HIV and access to information, in order for him to present recommendations to the Commission on Human Rights at its next session.

#### **Introduction**

1. The present report is the eighth report submitted by Mr. Abid Hussain (India), Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. The mandate was established by the Commission on Human Rights in its resolution 1993/45 of 5 March 1993. This report is submitted pursuant to Commission resolution 2000/38. Section I of the report contains the terms of reference for the discharge of the mandate. Section II presents an account of the activities undertaken within the framework of his mandate in the past year. Section III provides a brief discussion on a number of issues which the Special Rapporteur considers to be important for the development of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. Section IV contains brief summaries of urgent appeals and communications to and from Governments, along with observations of the Special Rapporteur. Lastly, Section V contains the conclusions and recommendations of the Special Rapporteur.

#### **I. TERMS OF REFERENCE**

2. The Special Rapporteur refers to his previous reports as regards the mandate and methods of work adopted by him. The structure of the present report is along the same lines as the previous report. The main body of issues includes an analysis on communications received by the Special Rapporteur (in order to highlight trends), the role of the new information technologies and concerns relating to actions of non-State actors, as well as issues pertaining to the enjoyment of the right to freedom of opinion and expression of women.

#### **II. ACTIVITIES**

3. During the period under review, the Special Rapporteur sent 16 allegations and 101 urgent actions. Seeking to avoid unnecessary duplication of the activities of the other thematic rapporteurs and country rapporteurs, the Special Rapporteur has joined during the past year with the Chairman of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in 32 urgent appeals and with the Special Rapporteur on torture in 29 urgent appeals. In the course of the year, 13 urgent appeals and 1 allegation were sent jointly with the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, 2 urgent appeals with the Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, one with the Special Rapporteur on violence against women and 1 urgent action with the Special Rapporteur on education. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur also joined with the Special Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (four urgent appeals) and on the situation of human rights in the Sudan (two urgent appeals). Finally, five urgent appeals were sent together with the Special Representative on the situation of human rights in Iran.

4. On 28 August 2000, the Special Rapporteur sent a note verbale to all Member States drawing their attention to the Principles on Freedom of Information Legislation (ìThe publicís right to knowî, E/CN.4/2000/63, annex II) and inviting Governments to reflect upon them and to submit their comments. The Special Rapporteur wishes to thank the Governments of the following countries which have sent a reply: Azerbaijan, Cuba, Latvia, Mexico and Qatar. He

awaits additional responses to undertake an in-depth analysis of the information submitted to him by Governments. It should be noted that the government replies received so far by the Special Rapporteur are available for consultation at the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, in Geneva.

5. The Special Rapporteur has received a large number of allegations concerning cases of violations of the right to freedom of opinion and expression in 2000. As was the case in previous years, the Special Rapporteur was only able to deal with a limited number of requests for information from some Governments, owing to the insufficient financial and human resources to fulfil his mandate in the manner he would deem appropriate. The matters raised in previous reports to the Commission on Human Rights regarding the circumstances of work (E/CN.4/1995/32, paras. 92-95; E/CN.4/1996/39, para. 6; E/CN.4/1997/31, para. 7; E/CN.4/1998/40, para. 3; E/CN.4/1999/64, para. 3; and E/CN.4/2000/63, para. 4) unfortunately remain of great concern. The mandate requires a substantially increased pool of resources. Within the current constraints, the Special Rapporteur has engaged in an exchange of views with Governments only with regard to a limited number of cases, which are discussed in section IV.

6. It should thus be emphasized that the countries discussed in the respective sections in no way reflect the extent of the problem worldwide, as indeed violations of this right take place in almost every country, in spite of the emergence of an increasing number of national institutions which are working for the promotion and protection of human rights.

7. The Special Rapporteur cooperates closely with the treaty bodies and human rights field operations, as well as with other specialized bodies within the United Nations system, regional intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, particularly at the local level, concerned with the right to freedom of opinion and expression. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur expresses his great satisfaction that the number of meetings and seminars he has attended and has been invited to has remained very high. However, owing to his heavy schedule, he has not been in a position to accept all the invitations transmitted to him.

8. The Special Rapporteur gave the keynote speech on press freedom and freedom of expression to the Commonwealth Press Union biennial conference, which was held in Bridgetown (Barbados) from 31 October to 3 November 2000. This conference brought together some 300 publishers, owners and editors from across the Commonwealth for three days of discussion and active debate.

9. The Special Rapporteur attended a round table discussion on ìThe protection of journalists in conflict zonesî in Berlin (Germany) on 6 November 2000. This event was hosted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, Joschka Fischer, and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Representative for freedom of the media, Freimut Duve. The Berlin Declaration adopted by the participants is attached as annex I to the present report.

10. From 14 to 16 November 2000, the Special Rapporteur attended an important seminar in Lima (Peru) on ìInformation for democracyî, organized by the Peruvian Press Council. The seminar focused on the right to information as a key component of freedom of expression, government transparency and democratic accountability. The Special Rapporteur welcomes the

ìLima Principlesî which were adopted at the end of the meeting (see annex II). This seminar was held at a time when political instability dominated the country. The Special Rapporteur felt that the quest for freedom of expression and access to reliable information was very important for the Peruvian people. This seminar also provided him with the opportunity to meet with local NGOs to discuss the situation of freedom of opinion and expression in Peru.

11. As far as the situation of freedom of expression in Latin America is concerned, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the adoption by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression on 20 October 2000 (see annex III). This declaration is aimed at ensuring more effective protection of the right to freedom of expression, fundamental for the consolidation and development of democracy.

12. In regard to cooperation with other intergovernmental organizations, the Special Rapporteur continued his collaboration with the Programme for Freedom of Expression, Democracy and Peace of UNESCO. The Special Rapporteur was also invited by UNESCO to the celebration on 3 May 2000 in Geneva of World Press Freedom Day, which was followed by a round table discussion on ìThe media in conflict and post-conflict areasî. The Special Rapporteur again made concrete recommendations in his mission report this year (see report on the mission to Albania, E/CN.4/2001/64/Add.1, para. 116), encouraging the use of UNESCO expertise in the field of media legislation and the training of journalists in coordination with the programme of technical cooperation of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).

13. Positive steps have been taken to establish more systematic collaboration with the OSCE Representative on freedom of the media (Freimut Duve) and the Organization of American States (OAS) Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression (Santiago Canton). Following the first meeting between the three mechanisms last year (see E/CN.4/2000/63, para. 12), where cooperation was initiated, it was decided that they would meet on an annual basis in the context of an international seminar. Thus, on 29 and 30 November 2000, a second international seminar on promoting freedom of expression with the three specialized international mandates took place in London. It was the occasion not only to promote cooperation but also to share information and ideas on the issues of defamation law, contempt of court and hate speech, as well as to hear the views of NGOs and other experts. Areas of cooperation between the three were also discussed. Following the meeting, a joint statement was issued which focused on two issues of concern, namely, attacks on journalists and defamation law (see annex IV). It was also agreed by the three mandate holders that they would issue a joint statement on racism and the media as part of the preparations for the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance. It should be further mentioned that another joint press statement was issued on World Press Freedom Day, 3 May 2000, about the harassment and killing of journalists in conflict situations (see annex V).

14. In the context of this cooperation, the Special Rapporteur considers the participation of the OSCE Representative on freedom of the media (Freimut Duve) and the OAS Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression (Santiago Canton) in the annual session of the Commission on Human Rights to be of particular importance. He regrets that Mr. Santiago Cantonís presence was questioned on certain technical grounds at the last session of the Commission, following a statement he made as a representative of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of

the OAS. The Special Rapporteur considers his collaboration with the two other mechanisms to be vital to ensure a coherent global strategy on freedom of expression. In this respect, he wishes to thank the United Kingdom Foreign Office as well as ARTICLE 19, the Global Campaign for Free Expression for their continued support.

15. The Special Rapporteur has been invited to the four regional expert seminars organized, as part of the preparatory process for the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, in Africa, Asia, Latin America and in the Central and Eastern European region. This is in accordance with the General Assembly resolutions asking for contributions from other human rights mechanisms (53/132, para. 35; 54/154, para. 37), as well as Commission on Human Rights resolution 2000/14 asking the special rapporteurs concerned to participate actively in the preparatory process. In paragraph 13 (g) of its resolution 2000/38 on the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Commission requested the Special Rapporteur to contribute effectively to the preparatory process for the World Conference by transmitting to the High Commissioner his recommendations on freedom of opinion and expression which have a bearing on the Conference. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur intends to present a submission to the High Commissioner for Human Rights which would also be submitted as an official document for the next session of the Preparatory Committee of the World Conference.

16. Additionally, the Special Rapporteur attended the seventh meeting of special rapporteurs/ representatives, experts and chairpersons of working groups of the special procedures and advisory services programme, held in Geneva from 5 to 9 June 2000 (see E/CN.4/2001/6, annex).

17. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur visited Geneva from 5 to 10 April 2000 for consultations and to present his report to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-sixth session. During this period, the Special Rapporteur held a press conference and organized a briefing for NGOs which were both very well attended. He also met with various delegations, and discussed his intentions of undertaking field visits with the Ambassadors of Albania, Egypt, Peru, the Russian Federation and Sri Lanka.

18. Finally, the Special Rapporteur considers the carrying out of country visits to be an essential element of the mandate. From 29 May to 2 June 2000, the Special Rapporteur undertook a mission to Albania. For this visit, he has submitted a separate report to the Commission at its current session (E/CN.4/2001/64/Add.1).

19. During the year under review, the Special Rapporteur has pursued his efforts to obtain invitations to visit the following countries: China, Indonesia, the Democratic Peopleís Republic of Korea, Sri Lanka and Viet Nam to examine in situ the situation with regard to the realization of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. In the course of 2001, he hopes to be able to visit the three countries which have invited him in 2000 (Argentina, Egypt, Peru). Moreover, the Special Rapporteur has also sent additional official requests for invitations to visit Angola, Colombia, Equatorial Guinea, India and Pakistan.

20. The Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate that the role of non-governmental organizations in furthering the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression cannot be underestimated. Indeed, it is those organizations which spearhead these concerns and are forcefully advocating, monitoring and lobbying for human rights. Some of them went out of their way to volunteer their time to help the Special Rapporteur. He wishes to express his special thanks to ARTICLE 19, the International Centre Against Censorship, which continues to provide information and material relevant to the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression to the Special Rapporteur.

21. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur welcomes the appointment of a Special Representative of the Secretary-General on human rights defenders (Ms. Hina Jilani). He considers this new thematic mechanism to be complementary to his own mandate and that it constitutes an important step towards better promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression.

## **III. ISSUES**

# **A. Trends**

22. As was the case last year, during the period under review, the Special Rapporteur has noted a number of characteristics common to the violations reported to him in the framework of his mandate and believes that it would again be helpful to consider what may be called ìtrendsî. It is his hope that the identification of these trends will encourage Governments to review practices and take remedial action where required. It is also hoped that this work will assist OHCHR in developing programmes of technical assistance for interested Governments which will accelerate the process of eliminating the causes of violations of freedom of opinion and expression, the right to information and associated rights.

23. The Special Rapporteur again acknowledges that in a number of countries independent media, professional or collegial associations and non-governmental organizations have been allowed to form and function. In such cases, there may well be a continuing need for training and guidance in order to raise professional standards and to develop the capacity of such bodies to thrive in a self-regulating environment. It is the Special Rapporteurís strongly held view that Governments have a duty to create and encourage an enabling environment in which such training and professional development can be organized and carried out without fear of legal, criminal or administrative sanction by the State.

24. The Special Rapporteur received over 1,700 communications from a variety of sources: international, regional, national and local non-governmental organizations, associations of media professionals, trade unions, members of opposition political parties, human rights defenders and activists, concerned individuals and others. It must be emphasized again that resource constraints do not permit the Special Rapporteur to respond to, or act upon, every communication received.

25. That being said, it can again be confidently stated that these communications are not confined to alleged violations in countries in which the political and institutional arrangements are implicitly or explicitly undemocratic. It is important to note that allegations refer to incidents and instances in which the rights to freedom of opinion and expression, information, association and assembly are infringed or violated in both emerging democracies and countries with long-established democratic institutions, practices and traditions. It is true, however, that the preponderance of allegations refer to situations where: (a) the legal and institutional protections and guarantees of human rights are, to a greater or lesser degree, circumscribed; (b) internal armed conflict or severe civil unrest exists; or (c) legal and institutional protections and guarantees exist but are not properly implemented.

26. A majority of cases received by the Special Rapporteur relate to violations and actions taken against media professionals. Similar actions and violations of rights also occur, however, in relation to political groups, members of opposition political parties, pro-democracy activists, lawyers, students, academics, trade unionists and their leaders, persons participating in general strikes, women, peasants, members of religious minorities, persons belonging to minorities, authors and poets, cartoonists, newspaper vendors, distributors and printers, medical personnel and others.

27. With these points in mind, the Special Rapporteur directs the attention of Governments to the following general trends in terms of violations of freedom of opinion and expression and related rights and strongly urges them to take all appropriate actions, consistent with the standards set out in the International Bill of Human Rights and associated instruments, to eliminate not only the violations themselves but also their causes and negative consequences.

# **1. Attacks, threats, harassment, physical harm**

28. The Special Rapporteur notes with great concern the extent to which efforts to exercise peacefully - and, in some cases, in a professional capacity - the rights to expression, opinion, information, association and assembly continue to carry the very real possibility of physical threat or harm. He would particularly like to express his deep preoccupation at the number of cases in which that effort has lethal consequences. In those cases, it can be said that there exists ìcensorship by killingî, carried out by all manner of agents of the State or persons with a perceptible, although perhaps not formal, affiliation with the State.

29. Acts of physical harm, threats or attacks against individuals exercising their right to freedom of opinion and expression, whether in a professional manner or not, referred to in communications by the Special Rapporteur have included: shooting and summary executions; death threats; kidnapping and torture of journalists in efforts to force them to reveal sources; attacks by police and military personnel on newspaper offices and homes; assaults and beatings in the context of elections and voting; use of pepper spray and beating by soldiers or police of participants in, or journalists covering, demonstrations and protests; surveillance of journalists by members of the armed forces; summoning of journalists to the presidential residence, the office of the Attorney-General, armed forces headquarters or police stations for ìinformal talksî, warnings and reprimands; occupation of a newspaper office by the civilian guard.

30. The Special Rapporteur has also noted a significant number of cases in which individuals were subjected to intimidation and harassment in the form of: the issuance against journalists of accusations of ìwanting to set fireî to the country, of publishing ìlies and hypocrisiesî or ìfalse

newsî, or of ìfuelling anti-government sentimentî; instructions to party members and local administrations to ìfind journalists and break their bonesî; searches of newspaper offices for ìsubversive and incriminating documentsî; the labelling of journalists as ìcriminalsî; warning journalists against reporting ìgarbageî about government leaders and leaders of opposition parties; threats against journalists for ìcontinuous negative coverage of activities in the Stateî.

31. The Special Rapporteur has noted that such violations seem to have often occurred: following the publication of accounts of police misconduct, excessive use of force, procedural irregularities in investigations or failure to investigate; as a result of commentary on corruption, involvement in criminal activities and wrong-doing by public officials, by members of the armed forces or the police, by members of municipal, State, regional or federal authorities, or by business and other elites; in State-sanctioned actions to suppress or disperse public demonstrations and protests; in response to the broadcasting of images of army or police repression against demonstrators; in response to published reports on poor and life-threatening conditions in prisons; in response to visits by media professionals to countries that do not enjoy friendly relations with the State.

## **2. Arrest, detention and related actions**

32. Despite changes in the legal and policy frameworks based on the rule of law and respect for rights in a number of countries, there continue to be many cases of arrest and detention without charge or without a legitimate legal basis, or following judicial proceedings of doubtful relevance.

33. The Special Rapporteur has observed that, in the past year, individuals have been arrested and/or detained on charges: of acting in a manner ìprejudicial to the safety of the State; of participating in a peaceful rally to protest election fraud; of ìcriminal malevolenceî for having reported racketeering and corruption in government and State-run companies; of having ìobstructed the implementation of martial lawî and for having ìinstigated a violent incidentî; of ìinsulting the head of State and inciting hatredî; of ìcollecting dissident news and secretly distributing copies of a monthlyî linked to an opposition party; of treason for having provided medical treatment to members of an armed liberation movement; of ìinsulting the magistracyî and ìviolating the press lawî; of having produced a film damaging to the countryís reputation abroad; of having published ìanti-patriotic informationî and statements considered ìseditious and anti-nationalistî; of having ìdistributed and disclosed false newsî; of having made ìdamaging accusationsî; of ìthe purchase and illegal provision of intelligence to foreign peopleî.

34. Such actions against journalists and others have often followed the publication of articles, for example: on police abuse of force causing death; about discontent in the armed forces; revealing misappropriation of funds by a government agency; on local corruption; on a weak voter turn-out for municipal elections and the deteriorating economic situation; on a person who had been tortured while in the custody of the presidential guard; calling on government forces to respect the human rights of those campaigning against impunity; containing objectionable language.

35. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur has noted that such measures have been taken by the police, military, security forces or other government authorities in relation inter alia to: investigations into embezzlement by government officials; the coverage of activities in a refugee camp; the distribution of foreign news articles; a government campaign against ìwestern bourgeois ideasî; the coverage of a protest movement; complaints by private business elites who were implicated in wrongdoing in published articles; a demonstration calling for law reform; ìrefusal to testifyî; the broadcasting of a music video that ìviolated moresî.

36. It should be noted that, if a majority of cases of arrest and detention involved journalists and other media professionals, communications received by the Special Rapporteur this year have also referred, inter alia, to the chairman of a political party charged with planning to hold an unauthorized demonstration and to leaders of an underground cultural movement. It should also be noted that, in a number of these cases, arrest or detention was either preceded by a raid on home or office or by summary action in public places. These actions often resulted in the peremptory and unlawful seizure of such materials as books, magazines, pamphlets, research, video and audio equipment, business documents, computers and other kinds of equipment used by the broadcasting media.

## **3. Administrative and legal measures**

37. As some countries slowly make the transition from outright repression to a framework of governance somewhat more consistent with the rule of law and respect for rights, a pattern of administrative and/or legal sanctions which fall short of arrest or detention is emerging. These sanctions result in violations which - while perhaps less intense in their effect than killing, arrest or detention - still result in violations and infringements of the rights that are the subject of this mandate. In a number of cases, the sanctions have a direct, immediate and significant negative impact on the right to seek, receive and impart information. As such, they are of grave concern to the Special Rapporteur and he reminds Governments of their duty to take immediate remedial action to eliminate these sanctions from law and practice.

38. A significant number of cases brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur concerned bans, closure or seizure of publications and/or other media, such as: the closure of a radio station that had aired a call by political parties for a mass gathering; the closure of a newspaper for reprinting allegations of corruption published by foreign media; the barring of a weekly for allegedly having published defamatory articles about a religious leader; the closure by religious courts of reformist publications; the closure of a radio station on the grounds that it was owned by foreigners; an attempt to close a newspaper through retroactive application of law; the suspension of a weekly that allegedly defamed members of the Government; the suspension of a weekly for ìpublication of false newsî; the banning of a weekly for promoting ìanti-country feelingsî; the confiscation by police of copies of an independent newspaper; the seizure of publications published outside the country which allegedly supported a foreign regime; the suspension of publications for ìdefiance of authorityî, and ìunbalanced reportingî; the refusal to license a publication because of the editorís link to the political opposition; the seizure and/or banning of weeklies for publishing interviews with, e.g. the leader of an opposition group or exiled critics of the Government.

39. In a number of cases, measures taken by the authorities against media outlets and actors took the form of the issuing of bans, inter alia on: covering official functions; reporting on military issues; demonstrations by opposition political parties; protest marches, so as not to ìembarrass the Governmentî; political and cultural magazines in order ìto protect general security, safety and public orderî; a book describing a massacre of religious youth by police. The Special Rapporteur also received cases referring to: a presidential decree of a total media blackout on a murder attempt against a journalist; the closure of publications for having published articles without official permission; the suspension of a radio station for having broadcast one verse of a poem by a writer who was imprisoned.

40. In addition to these types of administrative measures, the Special Rapporteur has also observed the use of technical and financial measures to impede the right to seek and impart information, measures such as: cutting off electricity to a television station that was broadcasting an interview with a rebel commander; a power blackout silencing media outlets while a state of emergency was declared in response to a social protest movement; the seizure of equipment from a wire service on the basis that it was operating without a permit; the jamming by State-owned media of signals and/or radio programmes of foreign broadcasting services; the seizure of equipment of an independent printing press on the grounds that it belonged to a foreign organization that owed the Government money; the imposition of a fine on bookstores; the seizure of foreign publications featuring articles about an opposition leader, on the basis that the articles were ìderogatory to national prestigeî; the fining of persons seeking to establish a non-government radio station; the closure of a printing house which was critical of the authorities and was sued for ìinsulting the nationî.

41. Furthermore, it has been noted that pressure has been exerted on media professionals and others through such administrative measures as: the dismissal of journalists and media personnel, inter alia for having broadcast images of pro-democracy protests and for being biased against the governing party; the denial of licences to private stations; the denial of entry permits to, or expulsion of, journalists, authors and editors on the basis that they are ìundesirableî; the withdrawal of journalistsí accreditation or imposition of lifetime bans for such reasons as ìdistributing information of a tendentious and malicious nature on the socio-political situationî in the country, ìwith the intention of tarnishing the countryís image of peace and stabilityî, or writing on relations between a State and a neighbouring country.

42. The recourse to legal and legislative measures has also been noted by the Special Rapporteur, for instance: the filing of suits by the authorities against journalists whose work they find ìinsults the honour and dignity of the State and the peopleî or is ìcontrary to national interestsî; charges of ìincitement to violence and rebellionî brought against a journalist under the Public Safety Act; amendments to the publications law that make the printing of foreign newspapers subject to the approval of the Minister of the Interior; indictment for blasphemy against a religion and its founder; prosecution of reformist dailies for having reprinted an interview with a public figure under house arrest; a press and publication law that criminalizes the publication of materials that ìsully public moralsî; prosecution of a singer for having ìinsulted religious valuesî; the sentencing of two women novelists and a publisher for publishing work that included ìexpressions that violate God, and indecent and shameless expressionî.

# **4. Defamation**

43. It will be recalled that in his report to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-sixth session (E/CN.4/2000/63) the Special Rapporteur devoted considerable attention to the issue of criminal libel and defamation. Similar to the use of administrative and legal sanctions to inhibit free expression and access to information, the cases received in the past year clearly demonstrate that the abuse of libel and defamation laws continues apace and there has been no significant decrease in the manipulation of such laws by key public figures, both State and private, with the aim of limiting the scope and content of press and other kinds of reports.

44. A summary review of the cases received revealed recourse to such laws in response to disclosures and/or publications about: the incompetence of an official; the link between the police and drug traffickers and/or between the Attorney-General and drug traffickers; the failure of a president to make good on election promises; the involvement of a minister in a corruption case; the issuance of false charitable receipts by religious entities; the refusal of a governor to authorize payment of salaries to public employees for three months; the acceptance of a bribe by a judge to decide in favour of one parliamentary candidate over another; the weak reaction of the authorities to racist attacks against nationals residing in a neighbouring country; the threat of a defamation suit to force a journalist to stop working with the independent press; the construction of a multi-billion dollar hydroelectric power project in which one of the players was characterized as ìcorruptî.

45. The information brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur also referred to such cases or subjects as: the implication of a member of the military in the assassination of the financial director of a district; the implication of a religious leader in a killing; corruption in the presidential palace; ìinsultsî against a member of Parliament; the publication of an article deemed offensive to the Supreme Court; links between local law enforcement and organized crime; administrative irregularities in a district judiciary that included the blackmailing of local mayors and abuse of authority; irregularities in the privatization process of a State-owned company; the use of power and influence to gain advantage.

46. Several cases were also brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur regarding prohibitive fines for libel which in a number of instances would strangle economically the independent press, a political party, an association or any individual. In this regard the Special Rapporteur considers that disproportionate remedies or sanctions can significantly limit the free flow of information and ideas.

47. In the light of the cases received this year, the Special Rapporteur would like to reiterate the recommendations made in his previous report (E/CN.4/2000/63 para. 52) and to urge Governments to:

(a) Repeal criminal defamation laws in favour of civil laws;

 (b) Limit sanctions for defamation to ensure that they do not exert a chilling effect on freedom of opinion and expression and the right to information;

 (c) Prohibit government bodies and public authorities from bringing defamation suits with the explicit purpose of preventing criticism of the Government or even of maintaining public order;

 (d) Ensure that defamation laws reflect the importance of open debate on matters of public interest and the principle that public figures are required to tolerate a greater degree of criticism than private citizens;

(e) Qualify only patently unreasonable opinions as defamatory;

 (f) Stipulate that defendants are not required to prove the truth of opinions or value statements;

 (g) Ensure that the onus of proof is on those claiming to have been defamed and not on the defendant(s);

 (h) Provide a range of remedies in addition to damage awards, for example, apology and/or correction.

48. In this connection, the Special Rapporteur would like to endorse the Principles on Freedom of Expression and Protection of Reputation**<sup>1</sup>** that have been developed by ARTICLE 19, the Global Campaign for Free Expression.

## **B***.* **Non-State actors**

49. The Special Rapporteur wishes to bring to the attention of the Commission on Human Rights and all Governments grave concerns about the actions of non-State actors which, in their effect, infringe upon or negate the rights to opinion, expression, information, assembly and association. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur notes that the traditional approach to the negation of the rights that are set out in international human rights instruments is generally confined to the question of violations of rights by Governments and their agents. Rightly, concern is expressed that any attempt to address the actions of non-State actors runs the risk of detracting from the responsibility of States not to violate the rights of citizens and others living within their territories. The Special Rapporteur also notes that the question of non-State actors has been traditionally defined as relating to the duty of States to exercise due diligence and to ensure that individuals and collective private entities respect the law and do not abuse or infringe upon the rights of others.

50. The Special Rapporteur accepts that the primary attention must continue to be focused on the commissions and omissions of Governments which lead to violations of fundamental rights. At the same time, however, he cannot remain indifferent to the fact that, with regard to the rights that are the subject of this mandate, an increasing number of actions by non-State individuals and entities have a marked and severely negative impact on the enjoyment of those rights by others.

51. A review of the communications received clearly indicates that, in a number of instances, the effect of these non-State actions is to impose ìrepression and intimidation by proxyî. The ìproxy effectî is either evident to the extent that the persons or groups involved are clearly

affiliated with the ruling party - whether elected or self-appointed - or can be inferred from the facts as presented. Other cases may be characterized as ìrepression and intimidation by neglectî, to the extent that the State consistently fails to meet its obligation to exercise due diligence and does not ensure that the police, the judiciary and other legally constituted bodies responsible for law and order properly and fully investigate crimes and related actions and hold those responsible to account.

52. The Special Rapporteur also acknowledges that there are circumstances in which the Government does not have effective control of territory within its own boundaries. Under such circumstances, it may not be possible for the State, at that time, to investigate, identify those responsible and ensure that their actions are properly and, under international legal definitions, lawfully sanctioned. The Special Rapporteur would observe, however, that difficulties in the immediate term do not relieve the State of its duty to exercise due diligence in the name of justice for the victims as soon as conditions permit. The Special Rapporteur would also observe that, in an effort to assert or regain control over territory within its boundaries, the State may not engage in actions that, by their very nature, violate rights or are of such a severe nature as to cause those targeted for such actions to react in ways that infringe or negate the rights of innocent persons who, very simply and often, have become trapped in the middle of a war of attrition.

53. With those points in mind, the Special Rapporteur notes that, in the past year, he has received cases of, among others, the following violations involving paramilitary groups, guerrillas, terrorist groups, mobs and traffickers: the kidnapping of journalists by guerrillas because of the failure of the press to disclose information about human rights violations committed by the army; the kidnapping of journalists by rebels calling on the Government to pledge money for road improvements; the kidnapping of foreign journalists and their use for ransom by armed opposition groups; the murder of journalists by members of a paramilitary group covering municipal elections; a bomb threat, possibly from paramilitaries hostile to a newspaperís editorial content; the shooting of a journalist who covered criminal bike gangs for years; the murder of a journalist who had reported on the illegal activities of a local mafia involved in drug-trafficking; the abduction by militants of reporters covering a hostage crisis; the sending of a parcel bomb to a journalist by a terrorist or group in armed opposition; the burning of copies of a newspaper by armed rebels.

54. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur noted a significant number of actions taken against media professionals by members of various opposition groups, political and religious groups, such as: an assault on a journalist by Communist militants; an attempt by students to burn down the offices of a newspaper; threats by security guards of an opposition party and an attempt to prevent journalists from covering a meeting of the party; the siege of an independent newspaperís offices by supporters of the prime minister criticizing the bias in pre-election coverage; a bomb attack on the offices of a daily newspaper by members of an armed secessionist movement; the bombing of a journalistís home by members of an armed independence movement; the murder of a journalist by members of an armed underground movement following articles critical of such movements; an attack on press vehicles by members of an armed opposition group; a ban by an opposition party on the media covering its election

activities; death threats against editorial staff by a religious militia; the denunciation of a private radio station by the Church for ìdangerous proselytismî; an attack by activists on video shops on the basis that they were ìimmoralî businesses.

55. Many other cases of violations reported to the Special Rapporteur involved other non-State actors, for instance: the shooting of a lawyer who specialized in labour issues and labour rights; the murder of journalists critical of the local administration by gunmen financed by ìrich people in the areaî; the setting alight of a journalist who had reported on corruption in the privatization of State businesses; an attack by youths on a journalist covering a studentsí meeting; an assault on reporters by polling station monitors; attacks on journalists by groups of demonstrators; the bombing of a radio station that had reported on incidents relating to a general strike; the murder of a journalist by a former public official following published comments that his resignation was linked to alleged misconduct; the ransacking and burning of a newspaper office by a mob protesting the murder of a leading religious scholar by unknown gunmen.

56. In the light of these and other cases, the Special Rapporteur invites the Commission on Human Rights to consider how and by what means the international community may give continuing and coherent attention to the question of non-State actors and actions by them that infringe upon or negate the internationally recognized rights to freedom of opinion, expression, information, belief and conscience, assembly and association.

## **C. New technologies**

57. It will be recalled that in his report to the Commission on Human Rights at its fifty-fourth session (E/CN.4/1998/40) the Special Rapporteur devoted considerable attention to the question of new technologies and, in particular, concerns expressed about the uses being made of the Internet. The Special Rapporteur noted an increasing interest on the part of some Governments, organizations and individuals in the question of whether or not it was possible to devise a generally applicable regime for regulation of the Internet. The heightened interest in regulation arose, at least in part, from concerns relating to privacy, the dissemination of pornography, racism and hate speech, and the use of the technology to promote, for example, child sex tourism, trafficking in persons and other activities or ventures that are increasingly viewed with opprobrium by individuals and the international community.

58. It will also be recalled that faced with the mounting pressures for the development of some sort of regulatory regime, the Special Rapporteur stated (para. 45) that the new technologies and, in particular the Internet ìare inherently democratic, provide the public and individuals with access to information sources and enable all to participate actively in the communication processî. At that time, the Special Rapporteur stated (para. 116) with regard to the Internet, that on-line expression should be guided by international standards and be guaranteed the same protection as is awarded to other forms of expression. Nothing has occurred since the report was prepared for the fifty-fourth session that would cause the Special Rapporteur to change his views on this subject.

59. On the contrary, the Special Rapporteur looks with dismay on the information he has received on the efforts of some Governments either to control or shut down access to the Internet. Some of the communications received by him referred to: the closure of a weekly

publication following the posting on its Web site of an article the Government claimed was biased; a charge of ìsubversionî against a web dissident, with a possible sentence of five years upon conviction; closure of a Web site acting as a forum for democratic dissidents, and the issuance of an arrest warrant against the webmaster; the arrest of the owner of an Internet site accused of ìincitement to subvert the Stateís authorityî for having published on-line articles critical of the ruling party; regulations on the content of a news Web site and chatrooms under which the sites may only publish on-line news from State-owned media; the requirement that official agreement must be obtained before foreign media news may be posted on-line; a stipulation that Web sites will be held responsible for publication of ìsubversive informationî; a law giving authorities the right to sanction service providers that do not control and censor the content of their sites; the issuance of guidelines banning the use of the Internet, inter alia for ìpropagating misleading news stories to create doubts among the public, at home or abroadî; revocation of all private Internet licences, allegedly because the persons involved falsified information in mandatory reports to the relevant ministry about the technical and structural details of their services.

60. Communications were also received relating to: a law requiring Internet users to request administrative authorization, following an incident in which three people, at least one an army officer, were accused of consulting opposition Web sites based in foreign countries; a regulation on ìthe protection of State secretsî on the Internet, requiring all information to be cleared by the government department responsible for the protection of State secrets and noting that breaches of the regulation could result in heavy jail sentences and fines; the arrest of a person as a ìcyber-dissidentî and the sentencing of that person for incitement to overthrow the State; the arrest of a person who was preparing to post on the Internet an information bulletin on human rights and the opposition democratic movement; threats by the Government to close down cyber-cafes if they did not monitor Web sites visited by their customers; a government statement that Internet users were not authorized to ìtake part in any activity that endangers public security, creates disorder or interferes with public rights and interestsî.

61. On the basis of these and other communications, the Special Rapporteur concludes that it is necessary to reiterate his encouragement to Governments to view the Internet and other information technologies as means to achieve a plurality of voices and to take steps towards their integration into the development process. Actions by States to impose excessive regulations on the use of these technologies on the grounds that control, regulations and denial of access are necessary to preserve the moral fabric and cultural identity of societies are paternalistic. Furthermore, inequalities of access to this technological revolution are liable to widen the gap between the technologically advanced sections of society and others, leading to political and social exclusion which would tend to create instability and explosive situations.

62. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur wishes to underline the following concerns and commends them to the Commission on Human Rights and other relevant multilateral institutions, for further and continuing attention.

#### **1. The gap between technologically advanced countries and societies and those with fewer assets and means**

63. The new technologies and, in particular, the Internet, are clearly important tools that can and should be put to use in the pursuit of respect for rights and social justice. Therefore, to the extent that there remains a dramatic disparity between rich and poor, developed societies and those less developed, in knowledge of, access to and creative use of these tools, this principle is not fully respected.

64. The Special Rapporteur has noted with considerable interest that a number of efforts have and are being made to achieve a balance of access and opportunity. In this regard, he commends two initiatives undertaken by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The first, MagNet, is a virtual library of the organizationís publications - such as policy documents, discussion papers and governance tools - on good governance, all of which can be downloaded free of charge (http://magnet.undp.org). It must said, however, that the positive impact and effect of this site will be directly proportional to the degree of access and technical capacity in those countries where the needed is greatest and the people are most likely to enjoy the greatest benefit.

65. For this reason, the Special Rapporteur finds the second initiative - also by UNDP - to be of particular importance. Through UNDP Africa a Web site has been created with the organizationís partners (http://www.undp.org/rba). This Web site has contributed significantly to the exchange of information and the sharing of ideas and initiatives. It must be stated, however, that the very considerable problem remains of there being too few lines of communication that carry full Internet access to and within countries in Africa. Also, in those places where access exists, it is expensive and often beyond the means of those who would enjoy the greatest benefit.

66. In this context, the Special Rapporteur would note that a decision by the international community, individual Governments and private businesses to invest the necessary resources to expand access to the Internet to under-serviced and unserviced areas and regions will be rendered meaningless if Governments initiate or continue policies and practices that have as their only aim to restrict access to information that is of relevance and importance to the people on whose behalf they manage and direct the affairs of the nation. That being said, the Special Rapporteur appeals to States and private interests - separately and together - to make every effort to increase the technological capacities in every country, state, municipality, community and neighbourhood where those capacities either simply do not exist or are not adequate to meet the needs of the people seeking to learn about and to use them.

# **2. Human rights and human development**

67. Human rights is the theme of the UNDP Human Development Report 2000. The report states that ìProviding information on national needs and government priorities can enhance public understanding of difficult trade-offs, creating a greater social consensus in the face of limited resources and multiple demands.î**<sup>2</sup>** The report also states that when ìpeople lack access to information on policies and practices that affect their well-being, there are many additional costsî.**<sup>3</sup>** The costs are noted as including the fact that corruption flourishes, press freedom is

compromised and powerful private actors can effectively buy secrecy ìeven for information that reveals serious threats to public health and safety.**<sup>4</sup>** The report further notes that the promotion of human rights norms can and should occur on three fronts: education of people about human rights; sensitizing officials to human rights; and mobilizing public opinion through the media.**<sup>5</sup>**

68. The Special Rapporteur concurs with the view stated in the report that the Internet is an important and related tool in the promotion of human rights and an effective means to disseminate information on civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights and violations of them. The Special Rapporteur firmly believes that the Internet has the potential to become one of the most effective tools available to fight against poverty and exclusion, on whatever grounds.

69. The Special Rapporteur further notes that, with regard to reducing global inequality and the marginalization of both people and nations, it will not be enough simply to install the ìhardwareî required in as many places as possible, as quickly as possible. With this in mind, the Special Rapporteur has noted proposals to establish regional centres of technology with the goal of providing research results, based on appropriate criteria, to poor people through the Internet and other technologies that reduce costs. While this kind of thinking and action is to be encouraged, the Special Rapporteur would again remind States that they must also ensure that there is adequate and unfettered ìsocial and political spaceî in which the new technologies can be developed in a self-regulating environment and where the exercise and enjoyment of the rights to expression, opinion, information, association and assembly can flourish. In the absence of freedom from excessive regulation and adequate space for expression, participation and action, the results of research will have no meaning and genuine participation, progress and human development will not happen.

## **D. Women**

70. The Special Rapporteur regrets that it has not been possible, thus far, to organize a joint mission with the Special Rapporteur on violence against women in order to assess the relationship between incidents of violence against women and the lack of effective enjoyment of the rights to opinion, expression, information, assembly and association. Neither has it been possible, to date, for the two Special Rapporteurs to develop a framework within which a joint report could be prepared and submitted to the Commission on Human Rights on this or a related matter.

71. That being said, the Special Rapporteur feels it necessary and appropriate to offer the following views with regard to ìwomen, peace and securityî as a part of his continued efforts to address consistently the situation of women and their ability, or not, to exercise freely the rights that are the subject of this mandate. During the October 2000 special session of the Security Council - on women, peace and security - the Secretary-General of the United Nations stated that ìthe potential contribution of women to peace and security remains severely under-valued. Women are still grossly under-represented at the decision-making level, from conflict prevention to conflict resolution to post-conflict reconciliationî.

72. The Special Rapporteur was informed that some of the statements made by participants in that special session referred to the experience of women and girls during armed conflict. For example: in the absence of gender sensitivity, women who have been raped and/or sexually

assaulted during armed conflict will not report the incident for fear of being stigmatized or some other potential effect of identifying herself publicly; electoral systems must take women into account, as voters or as candidates; civilian police must address the issues of trafficking and sexual violence which are associated with conflict.

73. The Special Rapporteur has taken note of resolution 1325 (200) adopted by the Security Council following this special session and emphasizes several elements of it for the benefit of the Commission on Human Rights and all States. In that resolution the Security Council, inter alia: stressed womenís equal participation and full involvement in all efforts for the maintenance and promotion of peace and security, and the need to increase their role in decision-making with regard to conflict prevention and resolution; called upon States to ensure increased representation of women at all decision-making levels in national, regional and international institutions and mechanisms for the prevention, management, and resolution of conflict; and requested the Secretary-General to provide to States training guidelines and materials on the protection, rights and the particular needs of women, as well as on the importance of involving women in all peacekeeping and peace-building measures.

74. The Council also called on all actors involved, when negotiating and implementing peace agreements, to adopt a gender perspective, including: measures that support local womenís peace initiatives and indigenous processes for conflict resolution, and that involve women in all of the implementation mechanisms of the peace agreements; and measures that ensure the protection of and respect for the human rights of women and girls, particularly as they relate to the constitution, the electoral system, the police and the judiciary. The Council also invited the Secretary-General to carry out a study on the impact of armed conflict on women and girls, the role of women in peace-building and the gender dimensions of peace processes and conflict resolution. The Special Rapporteur looks forward to the completion and publication of this study, with the hope that aspects of the rights to opinion, expression and information - and violations of those rights directed against women - will figure prominently in it.

75. In conclusion, the Special Rapporteur has raised the issue of women, peace and security out of a deep concern that women are not full participants in efforts to prevent, stop and recover armed conflict. The Special Rapporteur again emphasizes that effective participation depends on the ability to express oneself freely, to have access to the materials needed in order to have an informed opinion, to join with others in common cause for the common good, and to meet openly and without fear in order to discuss more widely the issues at hand and to act upon the decisions taken. None of these actions is possible when the rights to opinion, expression, information, assembly and association are violated. Thus, to the extent that there continues to be either advertent or inadvertent exclusion of women from peace processes, or the consciousness and deliberate enactment or application of laws that discriminate against women, their rights will always be violated and their participation in such critical areas as peace and security will continue to be unlawfully limited.

76. In the light of the above, the Special Rapporteur would urge States to weigh very carefully all of the points raised during the special session of the Security Council and to take all necessary remedial action, including law reform, to correct what is clearly an unbalanced and discriminatory situation.

#### **IV. COUNTRY SITUATIONS**

77. This section contains brief summaries of urgent appeals and communications to and from Governments, along with observations of the Special Rapporteur. In view of the time required for Governments to respond, only the communications sent before 15 December 2000 are included in the report.

#### **Afghanistan**

#### **Communication sent**

78. On 24 October 2000, the Special Rapporteur sent a communication to the Taliban authorities requesting information concerning their alleged control over the print and broadcast media, in particular the ban on television, the control over editorial work and the strict control over photography. In this context, it was reported that, on 11 August 2000, three foreign journalists, Khawar Mehdi, Jason Flario and Pepe Scobar, were arrested for taking pictures during a football match. The Special Rapporteur also raised the issue of the work of foreign journalists, which is reportedly extensively restricted by a list of ì21 points to be respectedî. In the same communication, the Special Rapporteur also transmitted cases of intimidation, harassment and violence towards journalists in exile. The following cases were also mentioned: the murder of Mohammad Hashim Paktianae on 2 November 1998 in Hayatabad; the murder attempt against Najeeda Sara Bid on 5 October 1998 in Peshawar (Pakistan); and the death threats received by Inayat-ul-Hay Yasini on 4 July 2000 in connection with the publication of the findings of an opinion poll carried out among Afghan refugees living in camps in Pakistan.

#### **Observations**

79. No reply has been received so far.

#### **Albania**

80. From 29 May to 2 June 2000, the Special Rapporteur undertook a visit to Albania, on which he has reported separately to the Commission at its present session (E/CN.4/2001/64/Add.1).

#### **Algeria**

#### **Communication sent**

81. On 18 October 2000, the Special Rapporteur sent a communication requesting information on government practices and measures which ensure a de facto control of print media by the State, in particular the extensive control over printing activities exercised by the five State printing companies (El Moudjahid (SIMPRAL), the Entreprise algÈrienne de presse (ENAP), the SociÈtÈ díimpression díAlger (SIA), the SociÈtÈ díimpression de líEst (SIE), the SociÈtÈ díimpression de líOuest (SIO)), as well as the control of paper imports by the State enterprise AlgÈrienne du papier (ALPAP), a control mainly exerted through the alleged use of financial debts to silence certain publications. It was notably reported that the SIA suspended

the printing of the weekly El Borhane only a month after its first issue in July 1998, allegedly because of a previous agreement of the weekly with SIMPRAL, which continuously refused to issue it. The publication of El Borhane was reportedly interrupted twice subsequently, in April 1999 and again on 2 January 2000, after the SIA requested payment of the weeklyís debt. The Special Rapporteur also brought to the attention of the Government three cases of alleged disappearance of journalists: Djamil Eddine Fahassi, who disappeared on 6 May 1995; Salah Kitouni, who has not been seen since 9 July 1996; and Aziz Bouabdallah, who disappeared on 12 April 1997 and on behalf of whom the Special Rapporteur had sent a communication on 13 November 1997. The Special Rapporteur requested to be kept informed of the measures taken by the Government to elucidate these disappearances.

## **Observations**

82. No reply from the Government has been received so far.

#### **Angola**

# **Communications sent**

83. On 15 February 2000, the Special Rapporteur, jointly with the Chairman-Rapporteur of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, sent an urgent appeal regarding the arrest of Andre Domingos Mussamo, a journalist for the Radio Nacional de Angola and Folha 8, on 2 December 1999. According to the information received, he was detained by the Police Criminal Investigation Department (DNIC) in NíDalatando, allegedly in connection with an unpublished article he wrote referring to a letter from the provincial governor to President dos Santos.

84. On 1 November 2000, the Special Rapporteur sent a communication concerning the drafting of a new press law. The Special Rapporteur welcomed the initiative and the fact that an open public debate on the draft law was taking place, and expressed his wish that the publicís views would be taken into consideration in the elaboration of the law. At the same time, the Special Rapporteur voiced his concern at some provisions of the draft, in particular articles 53, 55, paragraphs 2 and 3, and 57, in accordance with which press offences, as well as the publication of information considered as State secrets, would be punishable by terms of imprisonment of from 2 to 8 years.

85. On 17 November 2000, the Special Rapporteur transmitted a communication to the Government requesting information regarding the judicial harassment to which the privately-owned weekly Folha 8 has reportedly been subjected since October 1999. The Special Rapporteur referred in particular to the detention of William Tonet, editor of Folha 8, on 2 October 1999, allegedly in connection with his articles on government corruption; to the prohibition of travel delivered on 31 October 1999 to Gilberto Nero, a journalist for Folha 8, allegedly in relation with an article concerning the arrest in August 1999 of journalists of R·dio Ecclesia. Furthermore, it has been reported that Mr. Tonet, along with Joaquim Manuel Aguiar dos Santos, director of Agora, and Leopoldo Baio, director of Actual, were ordered to retract stories concerning government corruption on 10 December 1999. The Special Rapporteur also transmitted a series of allegations concerning the following persons: Josefa Lamberga, a

journalist with Voice of America, who was assaulted by a soldier on 28 April 1999; Isidoro NatalicÌo, a journalist based in NíDalatando, who was subpoenaed on 7 November 2000 by the DNIC in connection with a report issued on Radio Ecclesia about a public rally, and who also has an appeal pending in the provincial court against an eviction order to leave his home, issued on 20 June 2000, allegedly because of his journalistic activities; Jose Paulo, director of information for Radio Ecclesia, who was reportedly kidnapped by four unidentified armed men on 25 June 2000 in Luanda, allegedly in connection with earlier broadcasts on Radio Ecclesia about government corruption and acts of intimidations committed by the authorities; Isaias Soares, a journalist for Voice of America and Radio Ecclesia, who was banned on 2 August 2000 from covering official events and reporting on military issues in Malanje.

#### **Visit**

86. In his communication dated 17 November 2000, the Special Rapporteur requested the Government to extend an invitation to him to carry out an official visit to Angola in the near future.

89. On 6 December 1999, the Special Rapporteur sent a communication concerning the new draft law on the independence of the mass media. The Special Rapporteur voiced his concerns that the provisions for the registration of mass media outlets with the Ministry of Justice rather than the Ministry of Information and the Press could lead to stricter control over the press and the media, especially with regard to granting licences, accreditation of journalists, widening the scope of what is considered as defamation, and court proceedings against the mass media.

90. On 2 June 2000, the Special Rapporteur sent a communication regarding the closure of the Baku-based Monitor Weekly on 8 May 2000. The magazine was reportedly accused of failing to present a financial report for the first quarter of 2000.

92. In a letter dated 28 February 2000, the Government of Azerbaijan replied to the concerns the Special Rapporteur raised in his communication of 6 December 1999. The Government explained that the new bill was drafted in compliance with European standards and provided clarifications with regard to a number of provisions of the law. One of the superlative characters of the new law on the mass media was that registration of the mass media had been eliminated. In response to concerns about the issuing of licences by the Ministry of Justice, the Government replied that the new law did not include any provision about licence issuing procedure. It also stated that any control of newspapers by the executive bodies had been completely lifted and there was no provision in the law that could envisage permission being given by the executive bodies to close down media publishing. The Government added that no provision allowed for the control of the media on the basis of information interpreted as ìinsulting the honour and dignity of the Azerbaijani State and peopleî and ìcontradicting national interestsî. Finally, it said that, although the accreditation of journalists continued to be done through State bodies, the Government hoped to establish accreditation of journalists through the Association of Journalists in the near future.

93. In reply to the communication of the Special Rapporteur dated 2 June 2000, the Government provided, on 21 July 2000, information on the closure of the Monitor Weekly which was said to be the result of a court judgment against a predecessor publication, the Monitor, found to have insulted the Azerbaijani people, its history and national identity. The Government explained that, after the Monitor Weekly refused to comply with a court judgment, Ministry of Taxation officials suspended banking operations and instituted criminal proceedings against Mr. Huseinov, the company director and chief editor. Concerning the closure of the television company Sara, the Government indicated that it had cancelled the registration of the television company on 6 October 1999 after it continued to violate its charter and the Media Act by engaging in Islamic fundamentalist propaganda. Regarding the incidents involving the two Bu Gun journalists, the Government stated that they were taken to Yasamal district police station after the police had requested that they stop taking photographs of a police operation. One of the

photographers, Ravan Chingiz olgy Soltanov (Revan Chinghiyoglu), fell and sustained minor injuries while attempting to flee the scene. The Government explained that they were released following explanation, but that criminal proceedings had subsequently been instituted and an investigation opened.

94. In a communication dated 15 September 2000, the Government of Azerbaijan informed the Special Rapporteur of the result of the investigation concerning Rauf Arifoglu, which established that he was an accomplice in the highjacking.

The Special Rapporteur wishes to stress that his report was based on information transmitted to him before, during and after his mission by independent and credible sources and that each allegation was carefully verified to the best of his ability.

Arrested on 29 December 1994 following a government clamp-down on the activities of the UBCV, he

was allegedly detained without trial. On 5 July 2000, he was reportedly subjected to renewed interrogation and harassment by the security police because of a letter he sent in April 2000 in which he called for national reconciliation and respect for human rights.

## **Communication received**

304. In a communication dated 31 July 2000, the Government of Viet Nam informed the Special Rapporteur that a case against Ha Sy Phu was brought to the local court in Lam Dong province on 10 May 2000 in connection with his involvement in activities which violated the provisions of the Criminal Code of Viet Nam. The Government explained that he was allowed to stay at home because the court had not issued an arrest warrant against him. The Government denied that he was held under Administrative Detention Directive 31/CP.

## **Observations**

305. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its reply but awaits further information on the cases he raised this year. He would also like to reiterate his wish to undertake a visit in the country, as expressed in letters dated 18 March 1996 and 10 November 1999.

#### **Yemen**

## **Communication sent**

306. On 28 February 2000, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal to the Government concerning Jamal Amer, editor and columnist for the opposition weekly newspaper Al-Wahdawi. According to the information received, on 22 February 2000, a Sanaía court ordered a 30-day suspension of the publication and permanently banned Jamal Amer from practising journalism in Yemen after he published an article on 10 August 1999 describing the struggles that allegedly took place within the Saudi royal family in 1999.

## **Communication received**

307. In a reply dated 27 March 2000, the Government informed the Special Rapporteur that Jamal Amer was sentenced to pay a fine of 5,000 rials as a public disciplinary measure and was prohibited from practising the profession of journalism as an additional penalty - which was not a lifelong penalty. The Government explained that the sentence, issued in connection with the article which was said to have harmed relations between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Yemen, was in accordance with the provision of article 106 (a) of the Press and Publications Act. It further stated that the defendant had the right to lodge an appeal against the judgement.

## **Observations**

308. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for its reply.

309. On 15 December 1999, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal regarding the defamation charges brought on 8 December 1999 against the newspapers Blic, Danas, and Studio B by the Information Minister, Aleksandar Vucic, and the Deputy Prime Minister, Vojislav Seselj. The accusations were allegedly raised in connection with an article published on 4 December 1999 which reported statements made by Vuk Draskovic implicating the Serbian Secret Service in a recent assassination attempt against him. The three newspapers were penalized with heavy fines, which they were required to pay within 24 hours or risk seizure of corporate assets. It was reported that individuals might face up to 30 days in prison for non-payment of fines.

310. The Special Rapporteur transmitted an urgent appeal on 24 February 2000 with regard to threats reportedly made on 10 February 2000 by the Deputy Prime Minister, Vojislav Seselj, against the following print and electronic media: B2-92, Danas, Glas Javnosti, Vecernje Novosti and Blic. According to the information received, the Deputy Prime Minister accused independent Serbian journalists of being ìtraitorsî and ìaccomplicesî in the killing of Yugoslav Defence Minister Pavle Bulatovic and threatened violence against those journalists working for a ìtraitorous mediaî. Moreover, after the Yugoslav Minister of Information stated on 11 February 2000 that some elements of the Serbian media were working to destabilize the country, concerns were expressed that this was part of a strategy of intimidation directed at journalists working for media not controlled by the State.

311. On 13 March 2000, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning the charges brought against Studio B on 6 March 2000. It was reported that the Yugoslav Minister of Telecommunications served Studio B with an order to pay Serbian Telecom 10,755,314 dinars in fees usually charged for the temporary use of radio frequencies and television channels. As the holder of permanent licences, Studio B should reportedly have been exempted from that fee. Moreover, it was reported that, on 6 March 2000, Studio B had its transmission equipment stolen by attackers who reportedly wore police uniforms. In addition, the editor-in-chief and general manager of Studio B was reportedly fined 450,000 dinars for alleging involvement of the police in the attack on Studio B.

312. The Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal on 17 May 2000 concerning the police raid and seizure of the offices of Studio B on 17 May 2000. It was reported that the Serbian authorities took control of the station because it had repeatedly called for the overthrow of the Serbian Government, and that they dismissed the management and appointed Ljuboslav Aleksic, known to be close to the Serbian Government, as editor-in-chief of the station. Moreover, the attack on Studio B stopped the transmission of Radio B2-92, which broadcast from Studio Bís facilities. In addition, it was reported that access to the building housing Radio Index and the daily Blic was blocked to their journalists.

313. On 28 July 2000, the Special Rapporteur transmitted an urgent appeal to the Government concerning the sentencing, on 26 July 2000, of Miroslav Filipovic, a journalist with the independent daily Danas and with Agence France Presse, and a member of the Helsinki

Committee on Human Rights, to five yearsí imprisonment for espionage and to an additional two years for propagation of false information following a trial held in camera. He was reportedly arrested on 8 May 2000 by the Serbian Security Forces, released on 12 May, rearrested 10 days later and kept in custody for 30 days by the Military Court of Nis on allegations of espionage and dissemination of false information. His detention was allegedly prolonged by the military tribunal in order to prevent him from leaving the country he was indicted on 14 June 2000 in connection with the publication of articles regarding crimes committed by the Yugoslav army during the North Atlantic Treaty Organization intervention in Kosovo.

314. On 13 September 2000, the Special Rapporteur transmitted an urgent appeal concerning measures and actions taken against independent media in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Two bans on television broadcasts had been brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur: on 9 September 2000, the Yugoslav police seized the transmitter of TV Cacak, a measure allegedly taken in relation to the broadcasting of the election campaign of Vojislav Kostunica; on 7 September 2000, the staff of TV Rosulja was reportedly evicted from its offices by the municipal authorities of Vlsotince following frequent broadcasts by opposition candidates. In addition, it was reported that, on 29 August 2000, the Federal Ministry of Information ordered Novi Sad cable network stations to stop broadcasting the news programmes of five non-Serbian television stations, RTV Crna Gora, HRT2, HRT3, OBN and Duna-TV, under article 27 of the Law of Information. It was also reported that the work of two independent radio stations, Radio Jasenica and Radio Globus, was disrupted when their signals were jammed on 16 August and 22 August 2000 respectively. The Special Rapporteur expressed his concern about reports linking the disruption of the work of these independent radio and television stations with the federal presidential and legislative elections planned for 24 September 2000.

## **Communications received**

315. By a letter dated 18 May 2000, the Permanent Mission of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia informed the Special Rapporteur that violations of the freedom and independence of reporting of media and journalists in Kosovo and Metohija had been perpetrated by the International Security Force in Kosovo (KFOR) and the United Nations Interim Administration in Kosovo (UNMIK) in May 2000.

316. By a letter dated 28 August 2000, the Permanent Mission of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia informed the Special Rapporteur that the High Representative of the international community in Bosnia and Herzegovina had given an ultimatum on 18 August to the personnel of the Radio Yugoslavia transmission centre in Bijeljina to vacate the centre within 48 hours and stop broadcasting the programme of the State radio.

## **Observations**

317. The Special Rapporteur thanks the Government for the information provided regarding issues pertaining to freedom of expression in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, but awaits further information on the cases he raised this year. Moreover, the Special Rapporteur

welcomes the release of Miroslav Filipovic on 10 October 2000 after an appeal court overturned his conviction for espionage and spreading false information and after incoming President Vojislav Kostunica pardoned him the previous day.

#### **Zambia**

#### **Communication sent**

318. On 1 February 2000, the Special Rapporteur sent an urgent appeal concerning an alleged crack-down on journalists working for newspapers which have been critical of the Government. It was reported that David Kapangalwendo, a member of Parliament for the ruling party, had made comments threatening the safety and security of journalists, in particular in the Post newspaper, saying ìthey have gone too farî. He reportedly requested that the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Government ìdo something about such newspapersî and urged that action be taken against newspapers which make negative statements about the Government.

#### **Observations**

319. The Special Rapporteur regrets that no reply from the Government has yet been received.

## **V. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS**

320. While the Special Rapporteur notes with satisfaction a growing tide in favour of human rights and that almost all Governments seem to be upholding the sanctity of the principles of freedom of opinion and expression, at the same time he is still encountering innumerable cases of great violations of human rights.

321. The Special Rapporteur cannot help but view with dismay the content of the communications received in the past year. It is clear from them that the rights to freedom of opinion, expression and information are violated, almost as a matter of routine, in States with widely different political systems and institutional frameworks for governance. There are countries where these rights do not enjoy even the minimum protections and guarantees set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and associated international human rights instruments. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur encourages all States that have not ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to do so. Furthermore, he again urges all Governments to scrutinize their domestic legal systems with a view to bringing them into line with international standards governing the right to freedom of opinion and expression. Particularly with regard to the issue of national security, the Special Rapporteur urges all Governments to review not only laws specifically intended to protect national security but also ordinary criminal laws which may be used to infringe the rights to freedom of opinion and expression and to information. The criminal justice and the police systems also need to be overhauled to ensure a greater sense of justice and fairness on the part of the police. The Governments may also consider the feasibility of setting up national human rights commissions and positions of Ombudsman where these institutions do not exist.

322. In the light of the large number of allegations received relating to the abuse of libel and defamation laws, the Special Rapporteur would like to recall the recommendation made in his report last year (E/CN.4/2000/63, para. 205) that Governments should ensure that press offences are no longer punishable by terms of imprisonment, except in cases involving racist or discriminatory comments or calls to violence. Along the same lines, the Special Rapporteur would urge all Governments to ensure that the fines which the media or any organization/ individual are sentenced to pay for offences such as ìdefamationî, ìlibelî, ìinsultsî and publication of ìfalseî or ìalarmistî information are not out of proportion to the harm suffered by the victims. In no event should such fines be used by Governments with the intention of limiting the free flow of information and ideas.

323. The Special Rapporteur considers the increasing involvement of non-State individuals and entities in violations of the right to freedom of opinion and expression to be of grave concern. He invites the Commission on Human Rights to consider how and by what means the international community may give continuing and coherent attention to the question of non-State actors and actions by them that infringe upon or negate the rights to freedom of opinion and expression.

324. As regards the impact of new information technology on the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur would like to recall that new technologies, and in particular the Internet, are inherently democratic, provide the public and individuals with access to information sources and enable all to participate actively in the communication process. He remains concerned at information received regarding the efforts of some Governments either to control or shut down access to the Internet. The Special Rapporteur would, to the contrary, encourage Governments to increase the capacities in every country, in order to democratize the new technologies and to reduce the gap between the technologically advanced countries and others.

325. With respect to the right to freedom of opinion and expression of women, the Special Rapporteur urges Governments to take all necessary steps to remove formal and cultural obstacles to the exercise by women of their right to freedom of expression, including to receive information, and ultimately to give effect to all their rights. He would like to draw the particular attention of Governments to the recent adoption by the Security Council of resolution 1325 (2000), in which it urged States to ensure increased representation of women at all decision-making levels in national, regional and international institutions and mechanisms for the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts. Furthermore, the Special Rapporteur reiterates his hope of being able to prepare a report jointly with the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, to be submitted to the Commission on Human Rights next year. In this regard, he again invites submissions by Governments, intergovernmental organizations and specialized agencies, as well as non-governmental bodies.

326. Finally, in accordance with Commission resolution 1999/49 requesting the Special Rapporteur to integrate the protection of HIV-related human rights within his mandate, the Special Rapporteur would like to call on all Governments, NGOs and other specialized organizations to provide him with information relating to the issue of HIV and access to information, in order for him to present his recommendations to the Commission on Human Rights at its next session.

#### **THE BERLIN DECLARATION**

#### **6 November 2000**

 On 6 November 2000, leading media professionals and officials from the OSCE participating States, from the United Nations and the Council of Europe met in Berlin at a round table organized by the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Germany to discuss the protection of journalists in conflict areas. They adopted the following declaration.

#### **Journalists in danger - How we can help**

 The discussion at the Berlin Round Table underlined that the reality of conflict has changed considerably over the past years. During the last two decades, most journalists killed were casualties of internal conflicts. This type of ìterror warfareî has considerably changed the conditions on the ground, not only for military personnel but also for civilians, including journalists. Many participants stressed that the global media market puts ìpressure of presenceî on journalists through the demand of the media market to produce news in real time. This increasingly placed journalists in harmís way.

 In 1991, the OSCE participating States committed themselves in Moscow to protect journalists, particularly in cases of armed conflict. The United Nations, on several occasions, also expressed its strong support for measures to protect journalists.

 The Round Table in Berlin is the second step taken by the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media. He held a meeting with journalists and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in London in September 1999.

 However, more can still be done to provide support to journalists covering conflict areas. Already training sessions are organized by media companies and NGOs. Protection gear is available, as well as insurance. A number of international organizations in post-conflict areas offer a hotline for journalists in trouble. Although deliberately killing a journalist in time of war, as with any other civilian, can be classified as a war crime, little had been done to bring perpetrators to justice. This issue may be discussed as part of the ongoing debate on the International Criminal Court. Nevertheless, Governments could enhance their efforts to investigate the murders of journalists and to cooperate to this end. Governments should also make it clear within international organizations that the killing of journalists is not acceptable to the international community.

 The participants commended leading media companies, among them Reuters, AP, CNN, BBC, as well as NGOs, for developing universal guidelines relating to the safety and protection of journalists. However, these guidelines should not become excuses for Governments to exclude journalists or restrict coverage. The participants underlined that OSCE participating States should consider the idea that all journalists, including freelance and local journalists, have

access to safety standards and financial assistance in times of need. But most critical is that news organizations must assume responsibility for the safety of those who work for them, be they staff or freelancers.

 Regarding distinctive signs for journalists, it was stressed that this was an issue for journalists themselves to decide, but that an open discussion of physical threats against journalists was needed.

 The participants agreed that the discussion on journalists in conflict areas should continue in the framework of the OSCE, the United Nations, the Council of Europe and other relevant international organizations and NGOs.

#### **Annex II**

#### **THE LIMA PRINCIPLES**

#### **Preamble**

 Affirming that the rights to freedom of expression and access to information are fundamental to the very existence of a democratic society and are essential for the progress, welfare and enjoyment of all other human rights,

 Recognizing that these are inherent rights, neither granted nor conferred by the State, that the State cannot disregard them, and that their protection is essential,

 Recalling that the international and regional instruments which guarantee and protect these fundamental rights impose on States the obligation not only to observe but to promote universal and effective respect for human rights,

 Recognizing the important initiatives undertaken by civil society towards the effective implementation of these rights, in particular the Declaration of Chapultepec, the Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Johannesburg Principles,

 Welcoming the important efforts being made by the Special Rapporteurs on freedom of expression at the United Nations and the Organization of American States to promote and protect freedom of expression and the right to information,

 Affirming that it is essential that people have access to information held by the State in order to ensure the accountability of those who govern them, to allow citizens to participate fully in a democratic society and to guarantee the enjoyment of other human rights,

 Considering that transparency reduces the possibility of abusing power, that freedom of information in situations of democratic transition can contribute to truth, justice and reconciliation, and that lack of information adds to the difficulty of transition and reduces its credibility,

 Reiterating that issues of national security can never justify restrictions on freedom of expression and access to information that are contrary to the public interest as set out in these principles,

 We agree upon the following principles and urge all authorities, officials and persons at the local, national, regional and international levels to commit themselves to adopting the necessary measures to promote their dissemination, acceptance and implementation.

#### **Principles**

#### **1. Access to information as a human right**

 Every person has the right to be free to seek, receive, have access to and disseminate information without interference from the public authorities, prior censorship or indirect restrictions due to the abuse of official control. There is no obligation on the individual to state the motive for exercising this right. Access to information is both an individual right and necessary for a democratic society. The right covers both those who actively seek information and those who expect to receive information through the media and/or through official channels.

#### **2. Access to information in a democratic society**

 Every person has the right to ensure accountability in the work of the public administration, of State entities in general, and of public service companies. In order to carry out this task effectively, people require access to information held by the authorities. The authorities must be legally required to make information available to people in a timely and complete manner. It is the Governmentís responsibility to create and maintain public records in a serious and professional way, so that the right to information can be exercised effectively. Records should not be arbitrarily destroyed. This, in turn, requires a public policy which preserves and develops a corporate memory within the institutions of government.

## **3. Transparency and development**

 Access to information is indispensable for the scrutiny of and adequate debate on government action that are essential not only for transparent management of public bodies, but also to avoid corruption and other abuses of power. This right permits people to participate in public affairs and in decision-making and, more generally, permits the identification of public servantsí responsibilities, the objective evaluation of facts and the forming of opinion in order to increase participation in the political, economic, social and cultural life of the country.

#### **4. The authorities' obligations**

 Information belongs to the citizens. Information is not the property of the State and access to it is not to be granted as a governmental favour. The Government holds information only in its role as the representative of the citizens.

 The State and public service companies are obligated to respect and guarantee access to information for all individuals and to adopt the necessary legislative or other measures to promote respect for this right and to ensure its effective recognition and implementation. It is the Stateís obligation to promote a culture of transparency in society and in the public sector and to act with due diligence in facilitating access to information, identifying those who should provide information, forestalling actions which prevent its disclosure and sanctioning offenders.

 The conduct of officials who refuse access to information and the existence of legislation that allows this undermine this right.

#### **5. Journalism and access to information**

 Governments are obliged to guarantee and respect journalistsí right to exercise their profession, and the independence of the media. Journalists must be guaranteed the necessary conditions to obtain and disseminate information. Officials who interfere with this process must be subject to sanctions.

#### **6. Protection of journalists' sources**

 No journalist should be compelled by a judicial or other public authority to reveal his or her sources of information or the content of notes or personal or professional files.

## **7. Legislation on access to information**

 Norms establishing the right of access to information must guarantee the maximum amount of transparency and must specify that every person is entitled to exercise this right; that the information should be presented in the format requested by the applicant or at least in its original format; that the costs of the search, subsequent processes and transmission of the information will be assumed by the applicant through payment of a fee, which should not exceed the cost of the service; that the deadlines for access to and provision of information should be reasonable; and that appropriate sanctions will be established for officials who refuse to provide the requested information.

## **8. Exceptions to the right of access to information**

 Exceptions to the right of access to information may be legitimately provided for only in the Constitution and by law, in accordance with the principles of a democratic society, to a limited extent and only where necessary to protect a legitimate national security interest or the individualís legitimate right to privacy. Information shall not be kept secret on the basis of unpublished regulations. Any person or official who refuses to provide access to requested information will have to justify this refusal in writing and demonstrate that the information is included in the restricted category of exceptions. If the person seeking the information so requests, an impartial and competent judicial authority may review such refusal and may order the release of the information.

 The withholding of information under a broad and imprecise definition of national security is unacceptable. Any restrictions on the grounds of national security will only be valid when their aim is to protect the territorial integrity of the country and in exceptional circumstances of extreme violence that threaten the imminent collapse of the democratic order. Any restrictions based on grounds of national security are not legitimate if their purpose is to protect the Governmentís interests rather than those of society as a whole.

 Privacy laws should not inhibit or restrict investigation and dissemination of any information in the public interest.

 The law, having defined specified categories of classified information, shall establish reasonable deadlines and procedures for declassification as soon as the national security interest allows. In no case may information remain classified indefinitely.

#### **9. Protection of whistleblowers**

 No public servant or other person should be subject to any sanction for the disclosure of information classified under the restrictions referred to above, if the public interest in being informed outweighs the consequences that might arise from disclosure. In such cases the individual may benefit from special protection.

#### **10. Legal protection of the right of access to information**

 The autonomy and independence of the judiciary is fundamental to guaranteeing the right of access to public information in cases where the authorities or officials refuse to disclose information or place restrictions on its exercise. Prompt judicial action is indispensable to protect this right and to generate public confidence and transparency in the exercise of power. Added to these judicial mechanisms of protection is the right to petition other institutions, such as the Ombudsmanís office, and supranational bodies established to protect this and other rights.

Any existing regulations which contravene these principles should be abolished.

Adopted by the Seminar on Information for Democracy Lima, 16 November 2000

#### **Annex III**

## **INTER-AMERICAN DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES ON FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION**

#### **Preamble**

 Reaffirming the need to ensure respect for and full enjoyment of individual freedoms and fundamental rights of human beings under the rule of law,

 Aware that consolidation and development of democracy depends upon the existence of freedom of expression,

 Persuaded that the right to freedom of expression is essential for the development of knowledge and understanding among peoples that will lead to true tolerance and cooperation among the nations of the hemisphere,

 Convinced that any obstacle to the free discussion of ideas and opinions limits freedom of expression and the effective development of a democratic process,

 Convinced that guaranteeing the right to access to information held by the State will ensure greater transparency and accountability of governmental activities and the strengthening of democratic institutions,

 Recalling that freedom of expression is a fundamental right recognized in the American Declaration on the Rights and Duties of Man and the American Convention on Human Rights, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, resolution 59 (1) of the United Nations General Assembly, resolution 104 adopted by the General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, as well as in other international documents and national constitutions,

 Recognizing that the member States of the Organization of American States are subject to the legal framework established by the principles of article 13 of the American Convention on Human Rights,

 Reaffirming article 13 of the American Convention on Human Rights, which establishes that the right to freedom of expression comprises the freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas, regardless of borders and by any means of communication,

 Considering the importance of freedom of expression for the development and protection of human rights, the important role assigned to it by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the full support given to the establishment of the Office of the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression as a fundamental instrument for the protection of this right in the hemisphere at the Summit of the Americas in Santiago, Chile,

 Recognizing that freedom of the press is essential for the full and effective exercise of freedom of expression and an indispensable instrument for the functioning of representative democracy, through which individuals exercise their right to receive, impart and seek information,

 Reaffirming that the principles of the Declaration of Chapultepec constitute a basic document that contemplates the protection and defence of freedom of expression, freedom and independence of the press and the right to information,

 Considering that the right to freedom of expression is not a concession by the States but a fundamental right,

 Recognizing the need to protect freedom of expression effectively in the Americas, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, in support of the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression, adopts the following Declaration of Principles:

#### **Principles**

1. Freedom of expression in all its forms and manifestations is a fundamental and inalienable right of all individuals. Additionally, it is an indispensable requirement for the very existence of a democratic society.

2. Every person has the right to seek, receive and impart information and opinions freely under terms set forth in article 13 of the American Convention on Human Rights. All people should be afforded equal opportunities to receive, seek and impart information by any means of communication without any discrimination for reasons of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinions, national or social origin, economic status, birth or any other social condition.

3. Every person has the right to access to information about himself or herself or his/her assets expeditiously and not onerously, whether it be contained in databases or public or private registries, and if necessary to update it, correct it and/or amend it.

4. Access to information held by the State is a fundamental right of every individual. States have the obligation to guarantee the full exercise of this right. This principle allows only exceptional limitations that must be previously established by law in case of a real and imminent danger that threatens national security in democratic societies.

5. Prior censorship, direct or indirect interference in or pressure exerted upon any expression, opinion or information transmitted through any means of oral, written, artistic, visual or electronic communication must be prohibited by law. Restrictions to the free circulation of ideas and opinions, as well as the arbitrary imposition of information and the imposition of obstacles to the free flow of information violate the right to freedom of expression.

6. Every person has the right to communicate his/her views by any means and in any form. Compulsory membership or the requirements of a university degree for the practice of journalism constitute unlawful restrictions of freedom of expression. Journalistic activities must be guided by ethical conduct, which should in no case be imposed by the State.

7. Prior conditioning of expressions, such as truthfulness, timeliness or impartiality is incompatible with the right to freedom of expression recognized in international instruments.

8. Every social communicator has the right to keep his/her source of information, notes, personal and professional archives confidential.

9. The murder, kidnapping, intimidation of and/or threats to social communicators, as well as the material destruction of communications media violate the fundamental rights of individuals and strongly restrict freedom of expression. It is the duty of the State to prevent and investigate such occurrences, to punish their perpetrators and to ensure that victims receive due compensation.

10. Privacy laws should not inhibit or restrict investigation and dissemination of information of public interest. The protection of a personís reputation should only be guaranteed through civil sanctions in those cases in which the person offended is a public official, a public person or a private person who has voluntarily become involved in matters of public interest. In addition, in these cases, it must be proven that in disseminating the news, the social communicator had the specific intent to inflict harm, was fully aware that false news was disseminated, or acted with gross negligence in efforts to determine the truth or falsity of such news.

11. Public officials are subject to greater scrutiny by society. Laws that penalize offensive expressions directed at public officials, generally known as ìdesacato lawsî, restrict freedom of expression and the right to information.

12. Monopolies or oligopolies in the ownership and control of the communication media must be subject to anti-trust laws, as they conspire against democracy by limiting the plurality and diversity which ensure the full exercise of peopleís right to information. In no case should such laws apply exclusively to the media. The concession of radio and television broadcast frequencies should take into account democratic criteria that provide equal opportunity of access for all individuals.

13. The exercise of power and the use of public funds by the State, the granting of customs duty privileges, the arbitrary and discriminatory placement of official advertising and government loans; the concession of radio and television broadcast frequencies, among others, with the intent to put pressure on and punish or reward and provide privileges to social communicators and communications media because of the opinions they express threaten freedom of expression, and must be explicitly prohibited by law. The means of communication have the right to carry out their role in an independent manner. Direct or indirect pressures exerted upon journalists or other social communicators to stifle the dissemination of information are incompatible with freedom of expression.

#### **3 May 2000**

#### **Free journalism - the shield of democracy in periods of conflict**

 On the occasion of World Press Freedom Day, 3 May 2000, **Abid Hussain**, United Nations Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression, **Freimut Duve**, OSCE Representative on freedom of the media and **Santiago Canton**, OAS Special Rapporteur on freedom of expression joined in a statement about the harassment and killing of journalists in conflict situations:

 We note with deep concern that, in 1999, 87 journalists and media personnel were reportedly killed while carrying out their assignments, many in the context of conflict or postconflict situations.

 We emphasize the importance of access to information and, in particular, the right of journalists to seek, receive and impart information. Journalists are the shields of democracy - all the more during periods of conflict and tension. Free access to war zones is essential in order to enable journalists to fulfil their mission of informing the public.

 We urge Governments to respect and protect fully the right to freedom of expression, and the right of access to information in particular, by guaranteeing the security and safety of journalists in conflict and post-conflict areas. Guarantees should also be provided to prevent journalists from being subject to influence and pressure, so that the information they provide remains fair, impartial and non-partisan.

 We recall that, in accordance with international standards, during periods of conflict and tension, only the narrowest limitations may be imposed on the right to freedom of expression and information, and the law must have prescribed these. Consequently, all national laws that restrict this right in an abusive manner should be repealed.

 We reaffirm that in post-conflict situations the re-establishment of a free, independent and pluralist press constitutes an essential step towards rebuilding and strengthening democratic institutions.

 We reiterate that Governments and other power groups should refrain from using the media as a propaganda machine to call for violence and to disseminate racial hatred.

 We express concern about the lack of common principles regarding the access of journalists to areas of conflict or tension and request the international community to take adequate steps to ensure minimum standards applicable to all.

#### **JOINT DECLARATION BY THE UNITED NATIONS SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON FREEDOM OF OPINION AND EXPRESSION, THE OSCE REPRESENTATIVE ON FREEDOM OF THE MEDIA AND THE OAS SPECIAL RAPPORTEUR ON FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION**

 Having met with representatives of NGOs, UNESCO, journalistsí associations and human rights experts in London on 29 and 30 November 2000, under the auspices of ARTICLE 19, Global Campaign for Free Expression, assisted by Canadian Journalists for Free Expression;

 Recalling and reaffirming their Joint Declaration, made in London on 26 November 1999;

 Noting the importance of regional mechanisms in promoting the right to freedom of expression and the need to promote such mechanisms in every region of the world;

 Welcoming the recommendation of the African Commission on Human and Peoplesí Rights Seminar on Freedom of Expression and the African Charter that a special rapporteur or other mechanism on freedom of expression be established for Africa;

 Encouraging moves in ASEAN and in the Asia and Pacific region to develop regional mechanisms for the promotion and protection of human rights;

 Supporting the Inter-American Declaration of Principles on Freedom of Expression of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights;

 Endorsing the ARTICLE 19 document, ìDefining defamation: principles on freedom of expression and protection of reputationî;

 Stating our intention to adopt a joint statement on racism and the media as part of the preparatory process for the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance;

Adopt the following Declaration:

 Two threats to freedom of expression and the free flow of information and ideas have now reached crisis proportions in many parts of the world:

Attacks on journalists and others exercising their right to freedom of expression (censorship by killing); and

The abuse of restrictive defamation and libel laws.

#### **Censorship by killing**

 Attacks such as the murder, kidnapping, harassment of and/or threats to journalists and others exercising their right to freedom of expression, as well as the material destruction of communications facilities, pose a very significant threat to independent and investigative journalism, to freedom of expression and to the free flow of information to the public.

 States are under an obligation to take adequate measures to end the climate of impunity and such measures should include devoting sufficient resources and attention to preventing attacks on journalists and others exercising their right to freedom of expression, investigating such attacks when they do occur, bringing those responsible to justice and compensating victims.

#### **Defamation**

 All States should review their defamation laws in order to ensure that they do not restrict the right to freedom of expression and to bring them into line with their international obligations.

At a minimum, defamation laws should comply with the following standards:

The repeal of criminal defamation laws in favour of civil laws should be considered, in accordance with relevant international standards;

The State, objects such as flags or symbols, government bodies, and public authorities of all kinds should be prevented from bringing defamation actions;

Defamation laws should reflect the importance of open debate about matters of public concern, and the principle that public figures are required to accept a greater degree of criticism than private citizens; in particular, laws which provide special protection for public figures, such as desacato laws, should be repealed;

The plaintiff should bear the burden of proving the falsity of any statements of fact on matters of public concern;

No one should be liable under defamation law for the expression of an opinion;

It should be a defence, in relation to a statement on a matter of public concern, to show that publication was reasonable in all the circumstances; and

Civil sanctions for defamation should not be so large as to exert a chilling effect on freedom of expression and should be designed to restore the reputation harmed, not to compensate the plaintiff or to punish the defendant; in particular, pecuniary awards should be strictly proportionate to the actual harm caused and the law should prioritize the use of a range of non-pecuniary remedies.

 At the same time, the three special mechanisms recognize that new communications technologies are of enormous value in promoting the right to freedom of expression and the free flow of information and ideas, and express their intention to include this as a topic for discussion at their next joint meeting.
