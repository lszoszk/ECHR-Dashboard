Despite significant progress by States parties, this right is still not respected, which also seriously hampers the implementation of all other rights under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Furthermore, the failure to ensure the equal and inclusive sharing of decision-making power between women and men prevents States and the international community from effectively addressing urgent local, national, regional and global challenges. As noted in the preamble of the Convention, the full and complete development of a country, the welfare of the world and the cause of peace require the maximum participation of women on equal terms with men in all fields. To respond to these challenges for current and future generations, the present general recommendation contains an outline of a road map towards women’s full enjoyment of their right to equal and inclusive representation in all decision-making systems."

It outlines legislative, policy and programmatic measures to ensure the implementation of this obligation and overcome global challenges. It defines “equal and inclusive representation” as fifty-fifty parity between women and men in all their diversity in terms of equal access to and equal power within decision-making systems, hereinafter also referred to simply as “parity”. It defines “decision-making systems” as encompassing decision-making that takes place through formal and informal processes in all sectors, including in political, public, economic and digital spaces. Achieving parity therefore requires considering multiple arenas of decision-making and how they interact, and dismantling all obstacles that prevent women from accessing decision-making systems on an equal footing with men."

In 2022, women participated as negotiators or delegates on behalf of parties to conflict in 4 of the 5 active peace processes led or co-led by the United Nations. Proportionally, their level of representation stood only at 16 per cent, however, a further drop compared with 19 per cent in 2021 and 23 per cent in 2020. In 2023, none of the peace agreements reached included representatives of women’s groups as signatories. Women comprise only one third of participants in international forums debating such critical issues as the threat posed by nuclear weapons, increasing military expenditure, the proliferation of arms and ammunition and the weaponization of new technologies."

It is a key step towards a human rights-based economy. However, the overrepresentation of women in many informal, low-paying, less innovative and economically less lucrative sectors largely excludes them from decision-making positions and shaping the economy. They are underrepresented in decision-making in the economic governance architecture, multilateral financial institutions, debt servicing systems, capital markets, the industrial infrastructure architecture, trade negotiations and public procurement regimes. For example, women-owned businesses are awarded only 1 per cent of government contracts in the public procurement market, and women comprised only 17.7 per cent of inventors named in patent applications in 2023. Women occupy only 28.2 per cent of management positions in the labour market, and a survey of 185 central banks showed that only 16 per cent were led by women. In 2019, only 2 per cent of venture capital was directed towards start-ups founded by women. The growing importance of the digital economy and the continuing gender digital gap risk exacerbating this situation and creating new forms of systemic discrimination."

The critical role of women in disaster risk reduction is also highlighted in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030. Research shows that countries with more women parliamentarians are more likely to adopt policies on climate change and land conservation and ratify environmental treaties. Similarly, having more women on corporate boards has been linked to energy efficiency improvements and a reduced environmental footprint. In agricultural regions, women’s traditional and Indigenous knowledge is key to adaptive practices in farming, climate change management and resource management. However, women, especially young women, who are leading climate and environmental activism, are largely excluded from decision-making. As at 2020, women held only 15 per cent of ministerial portfolios in the environmental sector. The representation of women on party delegations at the twenty-eighth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change stood at 34 per cent, a proportion that has remained stagnant over the last 10 years."

This fifth industrial revolution has immense potential to benefit humanity if developed using an approach that is based on human rights, including women’s rights, and accessibility for persons with disabilities. Diverse perspectives and collective intelligence are essential to achieve this. However, due to gender gaps in access to technologies, including digital literacy, and in studies, careers and leadership positions in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), women have been severely underrepresented in the development of these technological advances. For example, women make up only 29.2 per cent of all STEM workers, and roughly 30 per cent of the artificial intelligence workforce. They comprise only 18 per cent of graduates from doctoral programmes on artificial intelligence, and 13.83 per cent of artificial intelligence paper authors. Only 12.4 per cent of women are C-Suite executives in STEM. Artificial intelligence systems have also shown a tendency to reflect and magnify gender bias, which manifests in discriminatory outputs, risking a rollback in gender equality gains and new forms of structural discrimination."

Patriarchy is a system of power deeply embedded in political, social, economic and cultural structures. It creates a hierarchy, historically assigning distinct roles, worth and qualities to women and men. It results in a division of labour whereby women are primarily responsible for the private sphere of the home and family, while men are the main actors in the public sphere of politics and economy, based on differential weights assigned to efforts in the two domains. Patriarchy permeates all societies. At its most severe, it takes the form of an institutionalized regime of systematic oppression and domination of women, committed with the intention of maintaining a regime that is increasingly referred to as “gender apartheid”.It is therefore crucial to codify the crime of “gender apartheid” to create full accountability for gender-based crimes."

However, gender inequality between girls and boys, young women and young men compromises their role in constructing a better world. Furthermore, existing approaches to youth engagement often view young people as a homogeneous group, reinforcing social norms and structures that perpetuate inequality. A transformative approach to young people’s engagement is required to reach parity in decision-making for current and future generations. Parity is essential to ensure that young people can build a peaceful, equal, inclusive and sustainable world that responds to their demands, implements their rights, ensures youth co-leadership and intergenerational solidarity, and enables them to anticipate and overcome crises."

The distribution of decision-making roles also often reflects patterns of gender segregation: the allocation of ministerial portfolios, for example, tends to be based on assumptions about stereotyped male and female responsibilities.

The Committee observes strong prevalence of gender stereotypes in all spheres of society, including their perpetuation and exacerbation through media portrayals of women reinforcing the dominant position of men. The rapidly emerging artificial intelligence sector, including generative artificial intelligence, computer vision systems, speech and audio artificial intelligence, robotics and control systems, specialized artificial intelligence systems and hybrid artificial intelligence systems, learns from frequently gender-biased training data, carrying gender-based discrimination from the analog into the digital world, and needs to be addressed urgently from a human rights, including women’s rights, perspective. Furthermore, some misinterpretations of religion and culture can shape gender stereotypes. The Committee emphasizes that gender stereotypes constitute a key barrier to women’s equal access to decision-making."

        "Text": "Equal access to all levels and aspects of education is enshrined in article 10 and further elaborated in general recommendation No. 36 (2017) on the right of girls and women to education. It is a key precondition for accessing decision-making systems on an equal footing with men and boys. However, the Committee observes that many women and girls still do not benefit from equal access to or participation in education, in law and in practice. The violation of this right is further exacerbated through intersectional discrimination, as seen, for example, against women and girls with disabilities. Even when equal access is granted, gender stereotypes are prevalent in the education system, including in teaching and learning materials, classroom practices, teacher training and biased attitudes towards girls and women both inside and outside the school environment, gearing them towards traditional fields of study and gendered behaviours. This not only keeps women out of certain disciplines that are critical to shaping the future, such as new technologies, including artificial intelligence, but also prevents them from envisioning themselves assuming a decision-making role. It is a key task of an education system to integrate an “education to empowerment”, ensuring that girls, boys, women and men are given the tools necessary to achieve parity and exercise leadership in an equal, responsible and ethical manner."

It seriously inhibits women’s ability to enjoy rights and freedoms on equal basis with men. In its general recommendation No. 35 (2017), the Committee defines gender-based violence against women as taking multiple forms, including acts or omissions intended or likely to cause or result in death or physical, sexual, psychological or economic harm or suffering to women, threats of such acts, harassment, coercion and arbitrary deprivation of liberty. Such violence may occur in all spheres of human interaction, whether public or private, including in the contexts of the family, the community, public spaces, the workplace, leisure, politics, sport, health services and educational settings. It can also occur online and in other digital environments and also takes the shape of structural, emotional and economic violence. It also often targets women human rights defenders, politicians, activists and journalists. The prohibition of gender-based violence against women has further evolved into a principle of customary international law, as illustrated in general recommendation No. 35 (2017)."

Gender-based violence against women in the public and the private sphere prevents women from taking initial steps toward representation in decision-making. When exercised against women in decision-making roles, it may push them out and constitute a chilling effect discouraging other women from reaching for such positions. Legislation to specifically address gender-based violence against women in political and public life, including against women human rights defenders, politicians, activists, journalists and voters, is frequently lacking. The Committee highlights the role of media outlets and social media platforms in committing, perpetuating and normalizing gender-based violence against women, and the role of political parties in trivializing such violence, including sexual harassment and other misogynistic behaviour, within their ranks. It also recognizes that gender-based violence against women, including in decision-making, is often exacerbated for women who are subjected to intersectional discrimination."

The women and peace and security agenda must be applied both domestically and internationally and both in armed conflict prevention and in building resilience to all impending and unanticipated crisis situations."
