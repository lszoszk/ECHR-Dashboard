It enables companies to curate search results and newsfeeds as well as advertising placement, organizing what users see and when they see it. (AI) technologies are used by social media companies to help moderate content on their platforms, often acting as the first line of defence against content that may violate their rules. (AI) recommends people to friend or follow, news articles to read and places to visit or eat, shop or sleep. It offers speed, efficiency and scale, operating to help the largest companies in the information and communications technology sector manage the huge amounts of content uploaded to their platforms every day. (AI) technologies may enable broader and quicker sharing of information and ideas globally, a tremendous opportunity for freedom of expression and access to information. At the same time, the opacity of (AI) also risks interfering with individual self-determination, or what is referred to in the present report as \"individual autonomy and agency\". A great global challenge confronts all those who promote human rights and the rule of law: how can States, companies and civil society ensure that (AI) technologies reinforce and respect, rather than undermine and imperil, human rights?",

For the foreseeable future, there will continue to be advancements with respect to narrow AI, according to which computer systems perform programmed tasks (human-developed algorithms) in specific domains. Narrow AI underpins, for example, voice assistance on mobile devices and customer service chatbots, online translation tools and selfdriving cars, search engine results and mapping services. Machine -learning is a category of narrow AI techniques used to train algorithms to use datasets to recognize and help solve problems. For example, AI-powered smart home devices are continuously \"learning\" from data collected about everyday language and speech patterns in order to process and respond to questions from their users more accurately. In all circumstances, humans play a critical role in designing and disseminating AI systems, defining the objectives of an AI application and, depending on the type of application, selecting and labelling datasets and classifying outputs. Humans always determine the application and use of AI outputs, including the extent to which they complement or replace human decision-making.",

The private sector certainly sees data that way: the more data available to feed algorithms and the better the quality of that data, the more powerful and precise the algorithms can become. Algorithmic systems can analyse huge volumes of data rapidly, enabling AI programmes to perform decision-making functions that were previously the domain of humans acting without computational tools.

Automation also enables the processing of vast amounts of data at a speed and scale not achievable by humans, potentially serving public safety, health and national security. However, automated systems rely on datasets that, in their design or implementation, may allow for bias and thus produce discriminatory effects. For instance, the underlying criminal history or visa data suggested above itself may incorporate biases. Excessive reliance on and confidence in automated decisions and a failure to recognize this foundational point may in turn undermine scrutiny of AI outcomes and disable individuals from accessing remedies to adverse AI-driven decisions.

AI-driven personalization may also minimize exposure to diverse views, interfering with individual agency to seek and share ideas and opinions across ideological, political or societal divisions. Such personalization may reinforce biases and incentivize the promotion and recommendation of inflammatory content or disinformation in order to sustain users' online engagement. To be sure, all sorts of social and cultural settings may limit an individual's exposure to information. But by optimizing for engagement and virality at scale, AI-assisted personalization may undermine an individual's choice to find certain kinds of content. This is especially so because algorithms typically will deprioritize content with lower levels of engagement, banishing independent and user-generated content into obscurity.

For example, facial recognition applications suffer from being grounded in predominantly white, male datasets, with errors occurring in up to 20 per cent of the time for women and people with darker skin colours. 37 When such systems are used to, for example, categorize images available through a search engine, their discriminatory potential can translate into concrete interferences with individuals' exercise of their rights to seek, receive and impart information and freely assemble or associate. \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",

In almost all applications of AI technology in the information environment, individuals are not aware of the scope, extent or even existence of the algorithmic decision-making processes that may have an impact on their enjoyment of rights to opinion and expression. The second and more challenging aspect is the scrutability of the AI system itself. The logic behind an algorithmic decision may not be evident even to an expert trained in the underlying mechanics of the system. Although it is logical to assume that more transparency around AI systems would enable greater scrutiny, algorithmic transparency does not necessarily equate with intelligible explanations of decision-making processes. Algorithms may obscure that a consequential decision has been taken or be so complex and context-dependent as to frustrate explanation. The situation is further complicated because companies operating in the information environment frequently update their algorithms; equally, machine-learning applications may change their own rules and algorithms over time.",
