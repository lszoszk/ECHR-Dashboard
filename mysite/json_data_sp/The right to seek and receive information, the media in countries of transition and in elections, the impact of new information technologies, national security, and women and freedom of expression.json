It is submitted pursuant to resolution 1997/27. Previously the Special Rapporteur, in pursuance of Commission resolutions 1993/45, 1994/33, 1995/40 and 1996/53, all adopted without a vote, submitted the reports contained in documents E/CN.4/1994/33, E/CN.4/1995/32, E/CN.4/1996/39 and Add.1 and 2, and E/CN.4/1997/31 and Add.1 to the Commission at its fiftieth, fifty-first, fifty-second and fifty-third sessions respectively.",

In accordance with the need for examining a number of specific questions concerning the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the structure of the present report has been amended. Consequently, the main body of analysis of issues related to the exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression will be discussed in section III, focusing on matters referred to by the Commission on Human Rights in resolution 1997/27 and which the Special Rapporteur considers as warranting special attention. These issues include the right to seek and receive information, the media in countries in transition and their role in elections, the impact of new information technologies on the enjoyment of the right, concerns relating to national security, as well as the right to freedom of expression as it relates to violence against women.",

As was the case in previous years, the Special Rapporteur was only able to transmit a very limited number of requests for information to some Governments, owing to the insufficient financial and human resources to fulfil his mandate in the manner he would deem appropriate. The concerns raised in previous reports to the Commission on Human Rights regarding the circumstances of work (E/CN.4/1995/32, paras. 92-95; E/CN.4/1996/39, para. 6; and E/CN.4/1997/31, para. 7) unfortunately remain of great concern. The mandate requires a substantially increased pool of resources.

In a number of democracies there has been a growing trend towards broadcasting, through radio and/or television, the debates and proceedings of sessions of national, regional, State and local assemblies as well as the courts.

The Special Rapporteur is of the view that the right to seek, receive and impart information imposes a positive obligation on States to ensure access to information, particularly with regard to information held by Government in all types of storage and retrieval systems, including film, microfiche, electronic capacities and photographs. In this regard, the Special Rapporteur has observed that in countries where the right to information is most fully realized, access to governmental information is often guaranteed by freedom of information legislation, which establishes a legally enforceable right to official documents for inspection and copying. In many cases the right to information is facilitated by independent administrative bodies which have been provided with adequate resources to fulfil their mandate and purpose. These bodies have the power to receive requests for information from the public and to issue decisions binding upon the government department or agency concerned. In those cases where the relevant department or agency has sought to deny access, the arbiter, i.e. the information commissioner or ombudsman, has had the power and authority to compel the Government to produce the information so that a decision may be made on whether the denial is legitimate. In general, the procedures established for requests for information filed by individuals, and for the receiving and processing of requests by agencies, are simple, accessible and reasonably rapid and the decisions are generally issued in writing, within a limited period of time. In those cases where a request has been denied, the reasons are provided and in a number of instances an individual whose request has been refused is entitled to seek a judicial review of the decision.",

He notes that Governments may discharge this obligation for instance by systematically integrating information about key civic issues, such as human rights, international treaties binding on the State, elections and other political processes, into the education system and popularizing the information through the media. Access to records such as court reports and parliamentary proceedings can be published in a timely fashion and disseminated through major public and university libraries throughout the country and, where technology permits, the Internet.",

In this context, the Special Rapporteur observes that independent and State-owned media contribute most effectively to the realization of the right to information in countries where there is a statutory presumption that journalists are not required to disclose their sources except in the most limited and clearly defined circumstances. Without such protection for both journalists and sources, the media's access to information and their ability to communicate that information to the public are likely to be compromised.",

The Special Rapporteur further commented that \"as discussions on the implementation of the right to development continue, laws and governmental practices which violate the rights to freedom of opinion, expression, information, dissent, association and participation must be taken into account ... (paragraph 65)\" and noted violations which, in several aspects, touch on the right to information. These aspects include suppression of political expression, denial of access to family planning information for women, discrimination against women through personal status laws, prohibition on the establishment of independent trade unions, prohibitions or restrictions on the operations of independent media and restrictions on access to information on subjects of public interest and importance. The Special Rapporteur recommended to the Commission on Human Rights that future discussions on implementation of the right to development take full account of the need fully to promote and protect the right to seek, receive and impart information because it, as well as the right to freedom of opinion and expression, is a fundamental prerequisite to ensure public participation, without which the realization of the right to development will remain in jeopardy (E/CN.4/1997/31, para. 66).",

The policy is intended \"to ensure that information concerning UNDP operational activities will be made available to the public in the absence of a compelling reason for confidentiality (emphasis added)\". 1/ While the operations of agencies within the United Nations system are not generally the concern of the Special Rapporteur, the point to be made in citing UNDP's policy is the presumption in favour of public disclosure. In the Special Rapporteur's opinion Governments everywhere should proceed on the same basis and in those States where there is either no policy at all or one based on a presumption of the need for restrictions, steps should be taken to enact a law or establish an effective administrative mechanism for the realization of the people's right to know and participate. The Special Rapporteur also believes that as regards the implementation of the right to development, full consideration must be given to the relationship between information, the active participation of the entire population and sustainable human development through which every individual can and will benefit.",

During his visits to Belarus and Poland, the Special Rapporteur was able to look at the different problems arising within the context of transition, particularly in the context of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, but which may equally be relevant to countries in other regions. The Special Rapporteur finds that a predominant factor was the need for establishing national independent television and radio services with a public broadcasting mandate, ensuring the independence of regulatory frameworks for private broadcasting, as well as ensuring that licensing procedures are apolitical and administrative matters only. Other issues of increasing importance was the reported lack of access to information held by the Government, as well as the protection of journalists' sources. Furthermore, it became clear that one question to be addressed concerns how to strike the balance between freedom and responsibility. In countries transforming their economic policies to follow the logic of the market rather than the State, additional problems have appeared, such as overwhelming influence of foreign media and the control by powerful interest groups of the main mass communications, thus creating the potential danger of depriving the population of balanced information from a variety of sources.",

In this connection, the Special Rapporteur wishes to recall his observation, resulting from his visit to Belarus, expressing concern at the biased coverage with regard to the elections in 1995 and the November 1996 referendum. He notes the observations made by the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia in her report on the situation of human rights in the Republic of Croatia. With regard to the elections of 15 June 1997, it was noted that the election observer mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) had concluded that the election may have been free but was not fair, and did not meet minimum democratic standards because the State media particularly television - showed favouritism towards the ruling Croatian democratic Union (HDZ) (see E/CN.4/1998/14). Equally, she observed in her report on the human rights situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina that during the period preceding the September 1997 elections, \"participation in political life was hindered by various obstacles, notably to freedom of the press\". These problems prevented genuine inter-entity (as well as intra-Federation) campaigning, and negatively affected the right of citizens to information (E/CN.4/1998/13, para. 16). In the latest report of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly on the situation of human rights in Cambodia, fair and equal access to the media as a crucial requirement of a free and fair election was equally emphasized (A/52/489, annex, para. 51).

In this context, the Special Rapporteur wishes to emphasize that great care must be taken to achieve an appropriate balance between the rights to freedom of opinion and expression and to receive and impart information and the prohibition on speech and/or activities promoting racist views and inciting violence.",

The Special Rapporteur further observes that the range of national models is so extensive as to raise serious doubt as to the possibility of adopting one particular approach as to the best way to tackle the problems and challenges posed by the Internet in the foreseeable future. For instance, in the United States, there is virtually an absolute right to expression and the United States Supreme Court recently decided that censorship provisions in the Communications Decency Act, an amendment to the Telecommunications Reform Act (1996), were unconstitutional and, further, that free speech on the Internet deserved constitutional protection. In some other countries, the actual state of the rights to expression, opinion, information, association and assembly is so restricted as to make any consideration of the dangers presumed to be posed by racism on the Internet virtually irrelevant. And in others, where a balance between rights and restrictions has been established in domestic legislation, the focus has been less on enacting further legislation than on enforcing existing law and working with Internet service providers to ensure that those using the technology to express and promote their views are doing so in conformity with the law.",

According to the Government-controlled newspaper New Light of Myanmar (NLM), the punishment is prescribed for anyone setting up links with a computer network without permission or who uses computer networks or information technology for undermining State security, law and order, national unity, the national economy or national culture or who obtains or transmits State secrets. Members of unauthorized computer clubs may, according to reports, be sentenced to prison terms of a minimum of three years.

It may also be recalled that, in 1980, UNESCO adopted a resolution which set out a number of points upon which a new world information and communication order could be based. These points included, inter alia: elimination of imbalances in the existing means and manner of information dissemination; elimination of the negative effects of public and private monopolies of media ownership; elimination of excessive concentration of ownership; creation of a plurality of sources and channels of information; freedom for media professionals with an associated responsibility to exercise that freedom wisely; respect for the cultural identity of peoples; respect for the right of each country to inform the world about its interests, aspirations and social and cultural values; and respect for the right of the public, ethnic and social groups and of individuals to have access to information sources and to participate actively in the communication process.",

These regulations presume to protect people from themselves and, as such, they are inherently incompatible with the principles of the worth and dignity of each individual. These arguments deny the fundamental wisdom of individuals and societies and ignore the capacity and resilience of citizens, whether on a national, State, municipal, community or even neighbourhood level, often to take self-correcting measures to re-establish equilibrium without excessive interference or regulation by the State.",

Thus, what has changed is not that such violence occurs but rather that more people are willing to recognize the occurrence of such practices and are actively attempting to counter them. The two recent tragedies of the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda are, understandably, most frequently cited now when discussing violence against women in the context of armed conflict. There is a lot of evidence regarding the terrible atrocities which were committed against women which must find an expression of protest. Such protest should come out clearly in the media and no restrictions whatsoever should be maintained which would suppress the voices of women. In this context, the Special Rapporteur also believes that far greater attention must be given to positive measures to break the silence. For instance, witness protection programmes are needed, for it is partly through the establishment and proper functioning of such programmes that women and girls will be able to fully exercise their right to expression, recount their stories and give testimony and evidence, without shame and without fear of social exclusion, retribution or reprisals against them or members of their families. Such programmes should also provide for the appropriate support services.",

Canadian institutions have contributed to this situation - by denying that such violence can exist, they have supported misogyny and abuse of power.\" 6/ The Panel also noted that women victims of violence in Canada, in common with women in every country, often keep silent about what has or is happening to them for a number of reasons, including fear of reprisal, shame, the belief that they are somehow responsible for the violence, the knowledge that they will not be believed, and, in some cases, suppression of the memory of violence because it is too painful to recall. And, finally, the Special Rapporteur was struck by the Panel's observation that research on the issue of violence against women in Canada remains incomplete because of exclusion, that is, that very little research has focused on the experiences of Inuit and Aboriginal women, women of colour, immigrant and refugee women, rural, poor or homeless women, women with disabilities, women with low literacy skills and lesbians.

In another case brought to the attention of the Special Rapporteur, in Peru, a woman received death threats because of her activities in a women's group that organizes educational programmes and provides legal and social assistance to working women. 8/ In Papua New Guinea, compensation for the killing of a clan leader, based on a complex tribal calculation, was determined to be \\$15,000, 25 pigs and an 18-year-old woman named Miriam Wilngal; the young woman said \"no\" because she wanted to finish high school and learn to be a typist; Miriam Wilngal was forced to take refuge in Port Moresby, some 500 kilometres from her angry relatives. 9/ Finally, the Special Rapporteur of the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities on traditional practices affecting the health of women and children referred to a case in Ethiopia (see E/CN.4/Sub.2/1997/10, para. 27).

In addition, the Special Rapporteur expressed his deep concern regarding the withdrawal of accreditation from Mr. Sheremet by the Foreign Ministry in early July, allegedly for biased reporting, an act recalling the revocation of accreditation and subsequent expulsion of Alexander Stupnikov, journalist with the Russian independent television channel NTV, in late March 1997 based on similar accusations.",

With regard to the withdrawal of the accreditation of Mr. Sheremet, the Government noted the view of the responsible committee in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Mr. Sheremet's reports systematically provided biased information about events in the Republic of Belarus and that the dissemination of such tendentious material resulted in the misinformation of the public, both in Belarus and in the Russian Federation. Alexander Stupnikov was deprived of his accreditation in the Republic of Belarus in connection with the dissemination on the NTV channel of deliberately false information about events in the Republic of Belarus, and with his reports, which were characterized by a one-sided approach to the coverage of events in Belarus. According to the response received, the activity of Mr. Stupnikov was contributing to the misinformation of the Russian public. Both decisions to withdraw the licences were taken on the basis of article 42 of the Act on the Press and other Mass Media.",

Sheremet, D. Zavadsky and Y. Ovchinnikov, had illegally crossed the State border of the Republic of Belarus on 22 July. Furthermore, it was noted that on 26 July, the representative of the Republic of Belarus for the Smorgon section of the border with the Republic of Lithuania was officially advised in writing by the commanding officer of the Vilnius detachment of the border police that a violation of the State border of the Republic of Lithuania had occurred. In that connection, a request for an investigation was made, with its findings to be communicated in writing. On 27 July, the above-mentioned persons were detained on suspicion of having committed the offence referred to in article 80 of the Criminal Code and the case was passed on to the investigations department of the KGB Directorate for the Grodno region. On 30 July, in the course of these criminal proceedings, P. Sheremet and D. Zavadsky were charged with illegally crossing the border and were taken into custody as a precautionary measure with the approval of the Public Prosecutor of the Grodno region, in accordance with the law.",

He was first arrested in 1978 and convicted for \"trying to change the constitutional order by force\" under article 146 of the Turkish Penal Code. The conviction was based on statements allegedly extracted under torture. He was sentenced to death, but this was commuted to life imprisonment on account of a physical disability. It has been reported that the Minister of Justice offered him a pardon on grounds of ill health, which he rejected. In 1991, Mr. Yagmurdereli benefited from a conditional amnesty which suspended prison sentences for offences such as the one contained in article 146 of the Turkish Penal Code. According to the source, prisoners who recommit the offence may be required to serve the whole of the remainder of their sentence. Some time after his liberation, he allegedly made a speech at a meeting organized by the Istanbul Human Rights Association to commemorate Human Rights Day. According to the information received, the Istanbul State Security Court handed down a sentence of 10 months' imprisonment for \"separatism\" under article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law in late 1995. The Court of Appeal upheld this decision on 26 June 1997. Consequently, the Smasun Heavy Penal Court decided, reportedly at the end of August, that Esber Yagmurdereli would be obliged to serve the remainder of his previous sentence.

On 27 November 1997, the Government replied that Mr. Esber Yagmurdereli, a writer and lawyer, and also member of the THKPC (Revolutionary Pioneers of the People) illegal terrorist organization, was sentenced to life imprisonment for having violated several articles of the Turkish Penal Code, including incitement to robbery by use of force and incitement to pillage. He was released under a conditional amnesty on 1 August 1991. It pointed out that the Turkish Penal Code indeed stipulates that in case of reoffence after a conditional amnesty had been granted, the offender would be required to serve the whole of the remainder in addition to the new sentence. The Government further noted that Mr. Yagmurdereli did in fact recommit a crime, in the incident contravening article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law (incitement to violence against the State through propaganda, a month after his release, on 8 September 1991. Following the hearings in the State Security Court, he was sentenced to 10 months' imprisonment on 28 May 1997. It was further noted that, in accordance with the law, he is required to serve also the remainder of the previous sentence, and was thus sentenced to a total of 23 years' imprisonment. His appeal was rejected on 20 October 1997 and he was imprisoned. The Government further informed the Special Rapporteur that on 9 November 1997, Mr. Yagmurdereli was released on health grounds, in compliance with article 399/2 of the Turkish Code of Criminal Procedure. It is emphasized that this decision is not an amnesty but that the release was based on health grounds and his sentence has been suspended for one year. The duration of this suspension is subject to the discretion of the Chief Public Prosecutor.",

The Special Rapporteur welcomes the Parliament's passing, in August 1997, of an amnesty law suspending the sentences of editors who had been held legally responsible and convicted for published materials and articles that appeared in their newspapers. This resulted in the release of editor Ocak Isik Yurtcu, former editor of the pro-Kurdish daily Ozgur Gundem, and other editors. He encourages the Government of Turkey to continue along this path and to accelerate further steps necessary to bring both practice and implementation of the right to freedom of opinion and expression into conformity with international standards. In this context, he would like to recall the observations and recommendations he offered the Government following his visit to Turkey (E/CN.4/1997/31/Add.1, paras. 48-63).",

However, as a positive note, he would like to emphasize that in several countries, democratic transformations and consolidations have brought about new liberties and freedoms. Freedom of expression has proved to be one of the most important elements in initiating change, contributing to peaceful transformations, as well as consolidating democratic regimes by providing the citizen with the means to participate in public affairs.",

This often goes hand-in-hand with undue restrictions on public protests and demonstrations, which call into question the right itself, as well as restrictions on the activities of independent trade unions or organizations of civil society. Furthermore, action taken by States and their agents against individuals - such as arbitrary detention, threat and intimidation, and extrajudicial executions - and actions against groups and organizations - such as the banning of opposition or ideologically diverse parties and professional associations - seriously erode the public's right to know and to receive and impart information.",

On the one hand, the caseload provides a strong indication that Governments continue to place undue emphasis on restrictions relating to the right to freedom of opinion and expression. On the other hand, however, it is also a reflection of the increased efficiency of information technology which not only provides greater possibilities to a steadily increasing number of persons around the globe to receive information, but also greatly facilitates the publicizing of human rights violations and their communication to international mechanisms such as this Special Rapporteur.",

As a rule, the Special Rapporteur believes that the best way to fight speech is through more speech. The Internet seems to be the ideal medium to apply this principle as it offers the immediate possibility of reply on an equal footing.",

Concerning the link between the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the rights of women, the Special Rapporteur expresses his great concern at the continuing silencing of women by various devices. He urges Governments to take all necessary steps to remove formal and cultural obstacles to the exercise by women of their right to freedom of expression, including to receive information, and ultimately to give effect to all their rights. In light of the importance of freedom of expression and how it relates to violence against women, the Special Rapporteur is of the view that a special effort should be made both to gather and analyse more information along the lines described in the present report. It is the hope of the Special Rapporteur to be able to prepare a report jointly with the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, to be submitted to the Commission on Human Rights next year.
