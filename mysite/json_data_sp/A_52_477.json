The Chinese Government replied as follows: \"Mr. Yulo Dawa Tsering, aged 66, from the Dazi county (Lhasa) is a bonze at the Garden Temple in Lhasa (Tibet). In 1959, he was sentenced to life imprisonment for having participated in rebel movements, but was granted a special pardon in 1979.

Similarly, reports suggest that without President B. N. Yeltsin's veto, the adoption of the \"Law on Freedom of Conscience and on Religious Associations\" on 23 June 1997 would have undermined the official recognition of religious groups and religious communities not belonging to the Russian Orthodox Church and restricted their activities. However, it is important to note that this law was definitively adopted in September 1997; - (iii) In Kuwait, citizenship is allegedly denied to non-Muslims; - (iv) In Brunei Darussalam, the Comoros, Kuwait, Mauritania, Oman, Qatar, Somalia, Uzbekistan and Yemen, non-Muslims are said to face a number of religious restrictions (see (d) below); (b) Other examples of violations of the principle of non-discrimination are found in allegations concerning refusal to grant official recognition to certain religious groups and religious communities (Azerbaijan, Georgia, Latvia and Uzbekistan);; (c) There are also reports of legal bans against certain religious groups and religious communities, particularly in the case of the Jehovah's Witnesses in Gabon and Indonesia;; (d) In Thailand, the textbooks in public schools allegedly provide information on Buddhism only, and thus do not reflect the diversity of religious sensitivities and affiliations in the country. Certain public schools in some cantons of Switzerland are said to run courses on the Church of Scientology in which it is described as a sect. Parents belonging to that Church are said to have wished to opt for private education, but to have been refused permission to establish a private school.",

In Georgia, the Orthodox Church is said to try to restrict the activities of other Christian organizations, while Romania is said to be hostile to members of the Greek Orthodox Church and to the Jehovah's Witnesses.

Exemption from military service may be granted in return for monetary payment, which is a discriminatory measure; - (ii) In Belarus and Mongolia, the law does not provide for an alternative to military service; - (iii) In Austria, Portugal, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, there is a legal time limit within which conscientious objectors must declare their refusal to undertake military service or apply to do nonmilitary national service; - (iv) In Austria, Portugal, Macedonia and Slovakia, the duration of alternative service is such as to make it appear a form of punishment; - (v) In Slovakia, there have been reports of conscientious objectors being sent to prison; - (b) The freedom to change one's religion is also being violated: - (i) In Qatar and Kuwait, the conversion of a Muslim to another religion is strictly prohibited and is punishable by death (Kuwait); - (ii) In India and Israel, draft laws banning conversion have been drawn up; - (iii) In Egypt, a Muslim who converted to Christianity was arrested and was allegedly interrogated to force him to provide information about the activities of converts; - (iv) In India, a Hindu who converted to Christianity is said to have been attacked by Hindu extremists. - (v) In Iraq, a young Christian woman was reportedly forced to marry a Muslim and convert to Islam; - (vi) In Myanmar, there are reports that the army has tried to conduct campaigns to convert Christians in the state of Chin to Buddhism. In one monastery, children are said to have been forced to repeat Buddhist prayers every day and some parents are said to have been paid sums of money in exchange; (c) The fourth category concerns violations of the freedom to manifest one's religion or belief:; - (i) In Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, China, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nigeria, the Russian Federation, Turkey and Uzbekistan, there are allegations that the authorities have imposed controls on or interfered illegally with the religious activities of all or certain religious groups or religious communities; - (ii) In Georgia and Romania, the national Orthodox Church is said to have tried to restrict the activities of other religions and religious groups and religious communities; - (iii) In Brunei Darussalam, the Comoros, Kuwait, Mauritania, Oman, Qatar, Somalia and Yemen, proselytizing by non-Muslims aimed at Muslims is said to be forbidden. In Azerbaijan, there is reportedly a law forbidding all forms of proselytizing by non-nationals. In Bulgaria, Jehovah's Witnesses are said to have been expelled, arrested, detained, mistreated or convicted because of their proselytizing work; - (iv) In Kuwait, Oman, Uzbekistan and Yemen, the publication of non-Muslim religious material is said to be prohibited, while the importation of such material is forbidden in Brunei Darussalam. In Nigeria, the broadcasting of religious programmes and listening to religious cassettes are said to be prohibited and punishable by imprisonment. In Mauritania, Christians have allegedly been harassed or even arrested for distributing Christian literature outside of their community; - (v) In Brunei Darussalam, the authorities are said to have imposed restrictions on the teaching of the history of religions and other subjects related to religion in non-Muslim educational institutions, and to require that Islam be taught there. In Armenia, permission for a teacher to provide religious instruction is said to depend on the approval of the national Orthodox Church; - (vi) In Afghanistan, non-Muslims are allegedly unable to practise their religion freely and Muslims are said to be forced to attend Friday prayer at the mosque.

Referring to the situation of the Greek Catholic church, the Romanian authorities stated that the process of restitution of properties confiscated under the former regime had been accelerated. \"The Upper Chamber of the parliament of Romania - the Senate - has passed new legislation on 12 June 1997 providing that the Greek Catholic Church is to be given back one church building in each locality in which the Orthodox Church has several church buildings and there are local residents of Greek Catholic denomination\". The authorities also stated that they were taking the necessary measures in relation to all displays of intolerance. With regard to the Jehovah's Witnesses, the authorities recalled that they were recognized by law and that their activities were protected against any act violating human rights. The Government's Department of Religious Affairs in fact adopted on 30 April 1997 \"an order addressed to all local public authorities, that recognized their full entitlement to have or build their own administrative buildings or places of worship\".",

As for the Shiites, the authorities maintain that nothing in the Shariah or in the Constitution establishes any distinction between Shiites and non-Shiites. The absence of any discriminatory practice against Shiites was likewise emphasized, as was the fact that the State punished any departure from this policy by isolated individuals. Regarding the allegation that the wearing of the turban during prayers was prohibited, the reply was that it would be inconceivable for the Government of the Kingdom to forbid following the example of the Prophet himself.
