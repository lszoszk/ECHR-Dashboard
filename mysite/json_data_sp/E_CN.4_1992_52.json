Among such sources, the Special Rapporteur has endeavoured to take due account of information from religious groups and denominational communities. He has given priority to the use of recent information for the period since the submission of his previous report to the Commission; however, particularly in the case of situations mentioned for the first time, or in order to take account of problems the origins or at least the manifestations of which go back a number of years, he has sometimes made use of earlier information and referred to it.",

Some of these comments concerned the determination of causes and responsibilities in the field of intolerance based on religion or belief. Although the Special Rapporteur deemed it advisable to stress the responsibility which might devolve on Governments in respect of religious restrictions or repression, it cannot be denied, as he stated in his initial report (E/CN.4/1987/35, paras. 29-45), that the factors hampering the implementation of the Declaration are extremely complex. While intolerance may in some cases be the result of a deliberate policy on the part of Governments, it may also frequently derive from economic, social or cultural tensions, and take the form of acts of hostility or conflicts between different groups. Behind phenomena of intolerance may also be found certain dogmatic interpretations which stir up misunderstandings or hatred between different religious communities or encourage dissension within them.",

It has also been alleged that the following new criteria for the selection of abbots in Tibet have also been established: - 1. Educational level; - 2. Leadership ability; - 3. Approval of the monastery's Democratic Management Committee (whose membership is said to be chosen or approved by the authorities); - 4. Approval of the Prefecture Religious Bureau. The Special Rapporteur has been informed that national legislation governing religious affairs concerning Tibetans has been adopted and would greatly appreciate receiving the text of this law. He would also be very grateful to obtain a copy of the provincial law on religious activity in Tibet as well as the 'Rules for Democratic Management of Temples' which were enacted by the People's Congress of the Tibetan Autonomous Region. In addition, he would also like to acquaint himself with the activities of the Tibetan Buddhism Guidance Committee. It has been alleged that a report concerning basic policy on religious affairs produced in February 1991 in the Ganze prefecture of Sechuan province states that 'Freedom of religious belief is a long-term policy which will prevail until the natural extinction of religion', adding that '...we are not totally ready for the natural extinction of religion, and we must make a long-term effort. The report states, inter alia, '...all the people living in Ganze prefecture knew that among the 80,000 people living in Ganze prefecture, 76 per cent are Tibetans, the majority of whom believed in Tibetan Buddhism, and there is a thousand years of history (of them believing in it). From here we can see very clearly that we must have a good nationality relationship in order to carry out the policy of freedom of religious belief. It has been said that the report further indicates that 'We must remember the lessons we have learned from the past when we adopted simplistic and forceful methods to extinguish religion and eventually got just contrary to what we had expected.' The report allegedly also states that 'To protect proper religious activities, it is also necessary for the masses of religious people and monks to do according to the party's religious policy. Religious activities and religious lives can only be developed and carried out within the scope of the permission of the policy and law', adding 'Of course, to undertake religious activities outside the religious site is abnormal, and must be forbidden.' It is also said to indicate that 'Religious professionals are responsible for liaising with the religious masses to manage religious affairs and keep them in order, and to preserve monasteries, especially those monasteries which have been listed as important cultural units.' It reportedly prescribes that 'We must bear in mind the reality of the masses of people in our prefecture. They have just been living a reasonably well-off life, and therefore we must advise them on not to donate too much money to religion, and not to start big constructions, in order to avoid waste of manpower, etc ' The report allegedly states further that 'It should be pointed out specially that the regulation on forbidding young people under 18 years of age to be religious was not seriously carried out in some areas. It is not allowed and (is) a violation of the policy to seduce young people into religion by taking advantage of their inexperience and inability to tell right from wrong.' The report is said to conclude by indicating that 'It is obvious, therefore, that it is a long-term, not-ending-until-the-naturalextinction-of-religion enduring work to continue to propagate the religious policy to the masses, especially the religious people, to raise their level of self-consciousness.' It has been reported that the Monlam (Great Prayer) Festival has been banned for the third consecutive year and that the streets in the Barkor area of Lhasa which are used for circumambulation of the Jokhang Temple were dug up during this period. It has also been reported that on this occasion a 24-hour curfew had been placed on monasteries near Lhasa from 1 to 11 March 1991 and that units of the People's Armed Police (Wu Jing) of up to 100 men sealed off the monasteries, thus preventing about 900 monks from leaving the monasteries of Drepung, Ganden and Sera. It has been alleged that a monk had been shot and wounded in the abdomen by the armed police on 1 March 1991. It has further been reported that monks who were expelled from monasteries, imprisoned and subsequently released and confined to their areas of origin are obliged to report to the local police authorities every seven days. They allegedly cannot leave the area without official permission and in the event that it is granted must return within seven days. These restrictions are said to be imposed for indefinite periods. If allowed once again to join a monastery, the monks are confined to the monastery area and required to report to the police every seven days. The reporting sessions are said to last an hour and include requests for information about other monks in the monastery. Monks are reportedly also restricted with regard to which monastery they may receive education from. Pilgrims visiting these monasteries are reportedly searched and special approval by the authorities is said to be required for the performance of religious ceremonies and rituals which are said to be limited mainly to outward manifestations such as circumambulation and prostration. It has been reported that the authorities have decreed that only 'normal' religious practices are allowed and only within specified buildings. All administrative decisions are said to be made by local officials, thus depriving the monastic officials of all authority. It has further been alleged that in February and May 1991 all monks and nuns in the principal religious institutions of Lhasa were confined by the authorities to their quarters for periods of up to two weeks and that permanent police teams were moved into these institutions. The admission of new monks and nuns has allegedly been banned. The numbers of teachers who are able to impart doctrine is said to be very small and declining. For example, it has been alleged that there were only two qualified teachers holding the geshe degree for 400 monks in Ganden Monastery. There are allegedly only 35 holders of the geshe degree at Sera Monastery, all of whom received their degrees more than thirty years ago. This is said to result in a significant generation gap between the novices and learned monks. As a result, only a small number are said to have reached the immediate level of training, especially since monks are reportedly only permitted to debate two hours each day. The Special Rapporteur was also informed that four Tibetan monks had been sentenced to an average of 15 years' imprisonment in November 1989 for translating the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. According to the sources, severe restrictions on travel both inside the country and abroad were imposed as of 27 September 1990, in anticipation of the Kalachakra religious initiation ceremony which was to be held in December in India. Local authorities are said to have received an 'Instruction on Doing Correctly the Work of Dissuading the Masses from Leaving the Country', with a view to discouraging people from attending this important Buddhist ceremony. It has been alleged that the orders specifically concerned persons who are leaving the country 'to hear prayers'. It has also been alleged that persons who had travelled abroad to attend the Kalachakra ceremony have been arrested upon return and imprisoned for six months. The Special Rapporteur has been informed of the arrest of the following monks who are currently said to be detained in Drapchi Prison. Since no reasons for their arrest were reported, the Special Rapporteur would be grateful if the Government could provide information with regard to the section of the Criminal Code under which they have been charged as well as the circumstances surrounding their arrest (the names are provided in the common phonetic transliteration): - 1. Lobsang Tsultrim, aged 75 Drepung Monastery - 2. Khyentse Legdrug, aged 27 Namrab Dag Monastery (Lay name: Phurbu Tsering) - 3. Ngawang Rangdrol, aged 20 Samye Monastery - 4.

In its reply, it said specifically: \"On the case of Mr. Carlos Peña Roa, the Government wishes to inform the Centre that he was sent to La Victoria Prison on 6 September 1979 on the orders of the Government Procurator of the National District for violation of articles 295, 296, 297 and 304 of the Criminal Code. These articles are concerned with murder, for which they impose penalties. On 10 April 1985, the First Criminal Chamber of the Court of First Instance of the National District sentenced him to 30 years' imprisonment. On 27 October 1989, the Penal Chamber of the Santo Domingo Appeal Court reduced the sentence to 20 years' imprisonment. Subsequently, the same court released him on parole, by Administrative Order No. 814/90 dated 26 July 1990, which was executed on 10 August 1990. \"As regards the detention of the persons mentioned in paragraph 2 of the Centre's communication mentioned above, they were released within the statutory period after being investigated. As to the fact that Pastor Arne Imsen, head of the Maranata Group, is prevented from entering the Dominican Republic, it is known that this group is not a religion but a movement; it is not registered in the Dominican Republic as a religious group, serious accusations having been made against it regarding acts committed in the Dominican Republic and in Sweden, which do not involve religious intolerance, but violations of the criminal law and public morality.\"",

        "Text": "28. On 27 May 1991, the Government of Egypt sent its comments to the Special Rapporteur regarding the two above-mentioned communications: \"An investigation conducted by the competent authorities has led to the following conclusions: With regard to the allegations made, the principal points of which relate to the apostasy of Nahid Muhammad Metwalli, the questioning of suspects in a case involving the defamation and disparagement of divinely-revealed religions and the incident in which the Reverend Shenouda Hanna Awadh was murdered, the following has been ascertained: The Egyptian Constitution guarantees freedom of religion and belief while, at the same time, designating as a criminal offence any disparagement of a divinely-revealed religion, even by one of its former adherents. Nahid Muhammad Metwalli (a teacher) had produced a tape recording, concerning her conversion to Christianity and her apostasy from Islam, in which she disparaged Islam and criticized the Holy Quran. In view of the danger that the content of the tape recording could cause a deterioration in intercommunal relations that might threaten the country's stability and security, the Department of State Security Prosecutions issued a warrant for the arrest of the above-mentioned person for questioning in State security case No. 587/89 and she is still a fugitive from justice. Some other Christian teachers from the same school in which Nahid Muhammad Metwalli was teaching circulated the tape recording that she had produced in a manner that showed contempt for the Islamic religion. The teachers concerned were Maurice Ramzi, Laurice Aziz, Eugénie Ya'qoub and Salwa Ramzi. The Department of State Security Prosecutions questioned the above-mentioned teachers in State security case No. 587/89, in which they were charged with the offence of exploiting religion to promote extremist ideology with a view to instigating sedition and expressing scorn and contempt for a divinely-revealed religion, namely the Islamic religion, and its adherents in a manner prejudicial to national unity and social harmony. It should be noted that the allegation referred to in the letter from the Centre for Human Rights is purely hypothetical and such hypotheses should be avoided, particularly in a report issued by the United Nations Centre for Human Rights. (b) The murder of Reverend Shenouda Hanna Awadh; On 11 May 1990, unknown persons opened fire on a vehicle in which Reverend Shenouda Hanna Awadh, the pastor of Ra's al-Tur'a Church at Abul-Matameer, was travelling with other persons. All the passengers were killed. On 12 May 1990, the police arrested a farmer, Rajab Muhammad Awadh Muhammad, the brother of Hassan Muhammad Awadh who was killed in 1989 by the brother of one of the Christian passengers of the vehicle at which the shots were fired. During his interrogation, he confessed that he had committed the act in order to avenge his brother's death. The weapon that had been used in the incident was also seized. The accused person is currently in detention pending trial in Abul-Matameer criminal case No. 2085/1990. On 13 May 1990, during the funeral of Reverend Shenouda Hanna Awadh, some Christian agitators attempted to endow the incident with confessional implications with a view to disrupting public security. This necessitated intervention by the security authorities, who arrested them and referred them to the Department of Public Prosecutions which ordered their detention (on a charge of riotous assembly in Bab Sharq adminstrative case No. 2861/90) for a period of 15 days, which the Department of Public Prosecutions subsequently renewed for a further period of 15 days in order to complete the investigation procedures which eventually led to their release in July 1990. It should be noted that national unity between the country's two religious communities has always constituted one of the sacrosanct pillars of Egyptian society and the Egyptian authorities take action against any person who attempts to prejudice this unity, regardless of his religion or belief.\"",

In a communication sent on 15 May 1991 addressed to the Government of Egypt, the following information was transmitted by the Special Rapporteur under annex I: \"According to the information received, three Egyptian citizens of Christian faith who had converted from Islam, Mustafa Mohammad Said al-Sharqawi (aged 30), Mohammad Hussein Mohammad Ibrahim Sallam (aged 25) and Hassan Mohammad Isma'il Mohammad (aged 21), are currently detained on charges of, inter alia. 'Contempt of Islam' and 'Threatening the Unity of the Country', which may entail prison sentences of three and five years respectively. It has been reported that Mustafa Mohammad Said al-Sharqawi and Mohammad Hussein Mohammad Ibrahim Sallam were arrested on the night of 28 September 1990, while Hassan Mohammad Isma'il Mohammad was arrested on 9 October 1990. It has been alleged that Mr. al-Sharqawi is detained at Abu Za'abal Industrial Prison while Mr. Sallam and Mr. Mohammad were initially said to have been detained at the State Security Intelligence Police (SSIP) detention centre in Heliopolis and subsequently transferred to Abu Za'abal prison. It has been reported that these persons were also imprisoned for several months at the beginning of 1990. It has been alleged that the three men had been subjected to severe torture, ill-treatment and verbal abuse at the beginning of their incarceration and that Mr. Hassan had refused to see his lawyer as they were allegedly severely beaten after every visit of their attorneys. It is believed that they are currently in good health and no longer risk torture. It has been reported that Mr. al-Sharqawi, Mr. Sallam and Mr. Mohammad were imprisoned without charge or trial under the State Emergency Act of 1978 which allows for no notification of the family or the right to visitation by legal counsel for a period of one month. According to the information received, Mr. al-Sharqawi and Mr. Sallam were tried by the State Security Tribunal on 25 November 1990 and found innocent on all charges. They were not released and the Minister of the Interior availed himself of the right to rescind the court order within two weeks and did so on 9 December 1990. It has further been reported that during a second hearing on 16 December 1990, all three men were once again declared innocent and the court ruled again that all three men should be released. Despite the second court release order against which the Ministry of the Interior is said to not have the right of appeal, the three men were not released and the Ministry of the Interior allegedly issued an additional arrest order in order that they may remain in prison. It has further been alleged that Mr. Hassan was declared innocent of charges on 10 January 1991 and released, but was immediately re-arrested by the State Security Police and incarcerated. It has been reported that at a hearing which took place on 27 March 1991, the court decided to extend the detention of Mr. al-Sharqawi, Mr. Sallam and Mr. Mohammad by an additional 45 days. An additional hearing took place on 12 May 1991 at which their detention is said to have been extended until 12 June, when they would be either tried or released. According to the sources, they may be charged under Articles 95 and 98 (f) of the Penal Code which, inter alia, concern 'opposing religious doctrines', 'actions against any heavenly religion', 'the exploitation of religion', 'propagation of extremist religious thought, and 'putting national unity and social peace at risk'.\"",

The penalties prescribed in the preceding article also apply to: (a) The printing or publication of scriptures that are revered by members of a religious community, whose rites are performed in public, in such a way as to deliberately distort and alter the meaning of the text of those scriptures.; (b) The mimicry of a religious celebration in a public place or gathering with the aim of ridiculing it or exposing it to public view.; The provisions of the Egyptian Constitution in this connection are based on the principles of freedom of religion and belief, non-discrimination among citizens in this regard, and the guarantee by the State of freedom of religious observance.

The following additional information was transmitted to the Government of Egypt on 31 October 1991, by the Special Rapporteur: \"According to the information received, there is no article in Egyptian law which speaks of conversion from one religion to another. While converting to Islam from another faith is allegedly approved, converting from Islam to another religion is not allowed and cannot be declared officially. It has also been alleged that employers sometimes indicate in advertisements for job vacancies that the applicants should be of Muslim faith. In addition, it has been said that £20,000 bonuses have been offered for converting to Islam. It has also been reported that, according to Law No. 25 of 1920, Law No. 52 from 1929 and Law No. 77 from 1943, if a man becomes a non-Muslim, he must divorce his wife, whether of his own will or by order of court. In addition, a person converting from Islam to another religion allegedly loses all inheritance rights from all Muslim relatives - parents, brothers, wife or children - and cannot receive any inheritance from a Muslim. The person reportedly also loses custody of children who are not of age. It has been alleged that if Islamic law is applied, the punishment for converting from Islam to another religion is the death sentence. It has also been alleged that no one can preach a religion other than Islam in public. The police would reportedly also prevent a person from making public statements of this kind and would arrest them in accordance with security police measures. According to the sources, persons who have converted to another religion from Islam either have to repent and convert back to Islam in order to continue living in Egypt or leave the country in order to avoid problems for themselves and their families. According to the information received, on 22 June 1991, a group of Muslim fundamentalists murdered Father Marcus Khahl Fanous, the eighty-year-old priest of Mosha village in the province of Asyut in Upper Egypt, who had been celebrating the first day of the Aiadha (sacrifice) feast. It has further been alleged that on 16 June 1991, the Government ordered Security Forces to surround the Coptic church in Alasafra district, Alexandria, and expel the worshippers while they were praying. It has also been reported that on the same day, security forces stormed another Coptic church in Ibrahim Basha village near the city of Samalout in Mynia province, Upper Egypt. They allegedly destroyed the church, hurled the priest to the floor and kicked him and terrorized the worshippers. All religious books and icons are said to have been thrown to the floor. According to the sources, presidential decrees are required to build or repair churches. As an example, presidential decree No. 157 was cited, which had been issued in June 1991 to repair the toilet and storage rooms of the church in Mait-Barra village in the province of Mounifia. It has been alleged that similar decrees are not required to build or repair mosques. It has also been reported that more than 200 applications to repair churches and build new ones have not been acted upon. This has resulted in the closing of a number of churches which have deteriorated and are dangerous to enter. It has also been alleged that the Coptic community is not allowed to build churches in newly developed towns and cities.\"",

In a communication addressed to the Government of El Salvador on 6 November 1990 (E/CN.4/1991/56, para 60), the Special Rapporteur transmitted the following information: \"With the declaration of the state of siege (November 1989), many reports indicate disturbing violations of the human rights of religious leaders or of helpers of the country's churches. According to the complaints, large numbers of persons are persecuted for belonging to specific religious demoninations which are involved, out of social commitment, in work with the underprivileged classes of society. Although these cases have taken place in a situation of widespread violence, the sources indicate that the persons have allegedly been the victims of violence on account of their community and church work. Attention is drawn to the following cases: (a) Extraiudicial executions:; Ignacio Ellacuria, S.J. Armando López Quintana, S.J. Joaquín López y López, S.J. Juan Ramón Moreno Pardo, S.J. Ignacio Martín-Baró, S.J. Segundo Montes Mozo, S.J. Elba Julia Ramos Celina Maricet Ramos (15 years of age) The six Jesuits mentioned above, their cook and her daughter were murdered in the early morning of 16 November 1989, during the curfew, at their home in the Central American University (UCA) of San Salvador. The Jesuits were administrators and teachers at the University. The Government entrusted investigations into the murders with the 'Investigating Commission into Criminal Acts', with the assistance of foreign police officers. On 19 January 1990, a charge was filed against Colonel Guillermo Alfredo Benavides Moreno, Director of the Gerardo Barrios Military School, two lieutenants and five lower-ranking officers for their alleged responsibility for the murders. According to information received, Colonel Benavides was in charge of the military patrol for the University area on the night of the murders. The other officers are members of the 'Atlacatl' Rapid Response Infantry Battalion. Complaints have subsequently been received about irregularities in the legal proceedings under way, including ill-treatment of key witnesses (allegedly in the case of Lucia Barrera de Cerna) and of deliberate concealment of evidence that could implicate higher-ranking officers as the people behind these serious acts. According to other sources, members of the Church received death threats. In March 1990, a communiqué from the so-called Alto Mando de los Esquadrones de Muerte (Death Squads High Command) threatened that, if all the members of the armed forces implicated in the massacre of the Jesuits were not freed before Easter Week (8-15 April 1990), they would 'eliminate all the members of religious denominations and civilians involved in the case'. The communiqué, which was sent to the local press, was also sent to churches, trade unions, political parties, professional organizations and to accredited diplomatic missions in the country. A complaint has been made that, on 19 and 20 November 1989, nine members of the St. John the Baptist Episcopalian Church were arrested in church by the National Guard. All the detained were also members of the Association for the Development of Awareness for Man's Spiritual and Economic Revival (CREDHO), a social programme of the Episcopalian Church. The detained were: Juan Antonio 'Berti' Quiñones Luis Gustavo López José Eduardo Sánchez Castillo Randolfo Campos Benavides Alex Antonio Tovar Flores José Candelario Aguilar Alvarez José Horacio Guzmán Julio César Castro Ramírez Luis Serrano All the above persons were subsequently released in December 1989 and January 1990. According to them, they were held on the premises of the National Guard and subsequently at Mariona and Santa Ana prisons, on charges of taking part in an armed action by the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN). Father Luis Serrano and Juan Antonio Quiñones said they had been beaten and threatened when they were in custody. It is maintained that, on 30 November 1989 the Treasury Police launched an assault against the parish church in Ciudad Credisa in San Salvador and arrested three persons cooperating in the Colonia 22 refugee project. They were: Estela Cruz Bustamante José Santana López Santiago de Jesús Vázquez According to their allegations, they were beaten, threatened, forced to wear hoods and deprived of sleep while they were held at the main barracks of the Treasury Police. They were released on 6 February 1990, 31 January 1990 and in December 1989, respectively. They had been accused, without grounds, of cooperating with FMLN. Furthermore, it has been reported that, on 19 January 1990, armed civilians detained Marina Isabel Palacios, a member of the Christian Committee for Displaced Persons in El Salvador (CRIPDES) in the centre of San Salvador. Weeks later it was learned that she had been detained by members of the 'Police Honour Battalion' and subsequently transferred to the Ilopango prison, where she was allegedly held on the charge of being a 'terrorist criminal'.

They were: > Victor Manuel Fuentes Carlos Armando Avalos Inocente Garay Although there is no precise information on their arrest, it was learned that they had been in the hands of the Treasury Police. The first two were released on 29 January 1990 and the third of them is allegedly still being held, on charges of being a guerrilla. (c) Detention and expulsion of foreign helpers of churches; Complaints have been received about the following cases: Jennifer Casólo, the representative in El Salvador of the 'Christian Educational Seminars' organization who was detained on 25 November 1989. She was held for 18 days in Ilopango prison, released on 13 December 1989, and deported to the United States. Father Miguel Andueza, a Spanish Dominican priest, who was detained by uniformed persons on 20 November 1989 in Santa Ana. Reverend Brian Rude, of Canadian nationality, who was detained on 11 November 1989 by the security forces and expelled from El Salvador. It has been reported that Catholic Archbishop Rivera y Damas received telephone death threats, as did Lutheran Bishop Medardo Ernesto Dénez Soto, who was forced to flee the country following bomb explosions at Lutheran churches on 28 December 1989 and 10 January 1990. Other sources have affirmed that the Jesuit Provincial in El Salvador also received death threats. According to other sources, on 23 November 1989 soldiers distributed a broadsheet in Teotepeque, accusing six members of the town's parish church of being communists and enemies of the people. The broadsheet was signed by a so-called 'Permanent Committee for National Salvation'.\"",

In a reply dated 18 November 1991, the Government of El Salvador supplied the following information: \"The annex raises questions about the investigation of the murder of the six Jesuit priests, their cook and her daughter on 16 November 1989. The question is also raised of what happened to Marina Isabel Palacios, who you say was transferred to Ilopango Prison, accused of terrorist activities. As regards the investigation into the case of the Jesuit priests, a trial was held and a jury court found two of those involved guilty. The judge subsequently sentenced those two (Colonel Benavides and Lieutenant Mendoza). It is felt in El Salvador that the murder of the Jesuit priests, some of whom had lived in El Salvador for many years with Salvadorian citizenship, was not attributable to their status as members of a religious order. The same year the terrorists murdered the former Jesuit, Mr. Francisco Peccorini; the cowardly murder of this distinguished thinker was not presented as religious persecution but as a political act.\"",

In a communication sent on 8 October 1991 addressed to the Government of El Salvador, the following information was transmitted by the Special Rapporteur: \"According to information received, there are continuing violations of the human rights of religious leaders and persons belonging to particular religious denominations which are involved, out of social commitment, in work with the most disadvantaged classes of society. Although these cases are continuing to take place in a situation of widespread violence, the sources state that these persons were presumably the victims of violence because of their pastoral and church work. It is reported that the groups operating against these persons do so with the support of the armed forces. Attention is drawn to the following cases: Bishop Medardo Gómez, President of the Salvadorian Lutheran Synod, is said to have received death threats on Monday, 15 July 1991, from the Salvadorian Anti-communist Front. Bishop Gómez had already received threats in 1989 and 1990, bombs were placed in his church on various occasions and many of those working with him were persecuted for performing their pastoral duties. He was also abducted for two days by a death squad in 1983, for supposedly collaborating with the guerrillas, during which time he was chained to a wall and given no food until he was handed over to the national police. In February of this year, Bishop Gómez was the subject of a defamatory campaign through a series of articles in the Salvadorian press accusing him of having links with the guerrilla movements. According to other sources of information, the nuns of the Little Community in San Salvador have been persecuted, have received death threats and have had their residence searched. It is reported that between 2 and 5 July 1991, the sisters received telephone calls threatening them, insulting them, accusing them of being guerrillas and telling them that they were under constant watch. A man's voice urged them to leave their religious premises in Primera Calle Poniente No. 3516 in San Salvador, saying that further action would soon be taken against them, as they had already been warned. According to the source, on 6 July 1991 their residence was searched, as they realized on finding the main door open and the house in darkness. The shrine in the chapel had been moved from its place, the religious community's three files had been forced open and the papers were scattered over the floor. A packet containing the sum of 40,000 colones intended for assistance to the poor had disappeared. The dormitories were in a state of disorder and the nuns' clothing had been turned upside down, including their work clothes in the garage. The cupboards had been thoroughly searched and their contents taken out and scattered about the floor. On the same day a vehicle was observed passing by the house of the Little Community, and two rifle muzzles were seen pointing out of the window at the Little Community. There were also other incidents which made the nuns fear for their lives and safety.\"",

        "Text": "36. On 5 December 1991 the Permanent Mission of El Salvador to the United Nations Office at Geneva transmitted the following response to the above-mentioned allegations. \"The Salvadorian system of criminal procedure is fundamentally based on proceedings consisting of two phases: (a) an investigation phase, and (b) an adversarial phase, the two forming a single process. During the investigation, the necessary actions and procedures are performed to establish the existence of the offence, to find out who is or are responsible and to discover circumstances affecting the criminal liability of the accused (Criminal Procedure, art. 115). The adversarial phase varies depending on the penalty provided by law for each act classed as a crime. The particular case of the Jesuits is being dealt with in ordinary proceedings, in which the adversarial phase began with the 'decision to send the case for trial'. The essential aspect of this phase is the public hearing before a jury court. This court is regulated by the Constitution (art. 189) and will consist of five persons appointed as jurors (Criminal Procedure, art. 315), who have to be over the age of 21, to be in full possession of their civil and political rights, to know how to read and write, to be of good conduct and to have a recognized profession, art, office or occupation (Criminal Procedure, art. 318). In this particular case the jury was made up of three men and two women, who met all these requirements and had been selected by the proper legal process (Criminal Procedure, art. 345). This court is required to deliberate and reach a finding on the guilt or innocence of the accused, and its decision is embodied in an instrument known as the verdict, which is based on the conscience and inner conviction of the members of the jury. This means that the assessment of the evidence is made in accordance with their inner conviction; the law does not require them to state how they have arrived at that conviction, nor does it lay down rules for determining whether the evidence is sufficient. The law merely asks them to ponder the matter themselves, in silence and tranquillity, seeking to let their consciences speak and to determine the impression made on their minds by the evidence produced for and against the accused. That is why the law does not ask them 'would you say this was true?', but 'have you an inner conviction? (Criminal Procedure, arts. 347 and 363). The jury court's decision is based on questions put to it by the judge, to which its members have to reply just 'yes' or 'no' in a secret vote. The jury court which heard the Jesuits' case gave its verdict in the manner described, convicting Colonel Guillermo Alfredo Benavides and Lieutenant Yusshy René Mendoza and acquitting Lieutenant Ricardo Espinoza Guerra, Sub-Lieutenant Gonzalo Guevara Cerritos and Privates Antonio Romero Avalos, Tomás Zárpate Castillo, Angel Pérez Vasquez, Oscar Marian Amaya Grimaldi and Jorge Alberto Cerna Ascencio (the last in his absence). The reasoning behind this verdict is possibly that Colonel Benavides, Director of the Military School, and Lieutenant Mendoza, an instructor at the School, were wholly responsible for the acts committed by their subordinates, since it was they who gave the orders. The other accused did not belong to the Military School, but to another battalion; they were not informed of the facts and were simply carrying out the orders of their superiors in a state of war, which is what the offensive of November 1989 was. It was considered, therefore, that members of the armed forces of lower rank could not oppose their superiors, possibly for fear of the consequences of disobedience, it being obvious that in normal circumstances it was not in any way possible to invoke the argument of 'due obedience'. The jury court is a manifestation of the sovereignty of the people, as represented by its members. Its finding cannot be questioned in any way and must be respected by the judge, who has to pass sentence on the basis of it and impose the penalties provided by law if the verdict is guilty. Questioning the verdict is totally unacceptable.\"",

On 4 November 1991, the Special Rapporteur transmitted the following information to the Government of France, under annex I: \"According to information received, Mr. Ludovic Bouteraon, aged 22, reported to the military service selection centre in spring 1990 and informed the military authorities that he wished to be given the status of a conscientious objector to military service. He asked to do alternative civilian service of a kind that would be compatible with his beliefs. It is alleged that Mr. Bouteraon was not informed of the procedure to be followed in order to be recognized as a conscientious objector. In July 1990, Mr. Bouteraon was ordered to report for military service on 1 August 1990 at an airbase near Strasbourg, which he did. On his arrival, he immediately stated that he had a conscientious objection to military service and refused to put on military uniform or carry arms. He was later arrested and held at the base until 17 August 1990, when he was brought before the 7th Correctional Chamber of the Court of Major Jurisdiction in Strasbourg, which sentenced him to 15 months in prison for insubordination. He was then\\ transferred to Elsau prison in Strasbourg. According to the sources, Mr. Bouteraon appealed against the decision and wrote to the French authorities on 8 August 1990, asking them to recognize him as a conscientious objector and to authorize him to perform an alternative civilian service. He repeated that he had not received information concerning the procedure to be followed when he was conscripted. In October 1990, the Minister of Defence rejected his request because it had been made after the statutory time-limit. It was alleged that on 13 September 1990, Mr. Bouteraon, who is still serving his 15-month prison sentence for refusing to do military service, was transferred to a civilian prison at Colmar pending his appeal to Colmar Appeal Court on 6 November 1990.

On 31 May 1991, the Permanent Mission of Greece to the United Nations Office at Geneva addressed a reply to the Special Rapporteur regarding the above-mentioned allegations, which stated the following: \"The Legislative Act regarding Muslim Religious Ministers in Thrace provides as follows: A. An enlarged committee is convened by the official, superior to the Prefect, namely the competent Regional Secretary-General. This committee chaired by the Prefect consists of Greek Muslim clergy and prominent Greek Muslim citizens. They propose to the Minister of Education and Religious Affairs a list of qualified persons (holders of a university degree of high Islamic School, national or foreign, or holders of itzazetname diploma, or persons having served as imam for at least ten years and who distinguished themselves for their morality and theological proficiency). From among them, the Minister chooses on the basis of personal qualification of each candidate. The Mufti is finally appointed by presidential decree issued upon proposal of the Minister of Education. In this connection it should be recalled that the appointment by the State of a head of clergy is common practice in countries where Islam constitutes the predominant religion (e.g. Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Turkey, etc.). It should also be emphasized that the designation of the Mufti through popular election would meet with a serious obstacle. For, as it is known, Greece is the unique western country to accept the exercise of jurisdiction by a head of Muslim clergy. Indeed the Mufti disposes of judicial jurisdiction extended to issues of family and inheritance law. It is, therefore, clear that the appointment through popular election would jeopardize the implementation of the constitutional requirements of assigning judges by law (art. 8 of the Constitution) and the principle of the functional and personal independence of the judge - principles respected by most modern and orderly States. B. A Mufti may be relieved of duties by presidential decree, upon request from the Minister of Education, in the following cases only: (a) In case of an irrevocable condemnation for crime or misdemeanour, as provided in article 22 of the Code of Civil Servants;; (b) In case of deprivation of civil right for any reason;; (c) In case of illness hampering the exercise of his duties, or professional inadequacy, or conduct undignified or incompatible with his position and duties.; The concurrence of the conditions specified in category (c) is ascertained by decision of a council consisting of a second instance magistrate of Athens, as President, and a high or top-level official of the Ministry of Education and a Mufti or Mufti ad interim, as members.\"",

Mr. Mehmet Emin Aga is said to have been elected by vote by a show of hands taken in 52 mosques of Xanthi district after the Friday prayer on 17 August 1990. It has been reported that four candidates took part in the election, with Mr. Mehmet Emin Aga receiving a large majority of votes. The results of the election are said to have been duly communicated to the Governor of Xanthi. The Muslim community pointed out that the new law whereby a Mufti is appointed rather than elected is unacceptable to them. A petition submitted to the Parliament protesting the appointment was reportedly signed by all the religious leaders of this community which is said to have expressed its unequivocal opposition to the appointment of Muftis. It has further been reported that the Prelate of the Greek Orthodox Church and the Directorate of the Greek Jewish communities are both elected.

On 30 November 1991, the Permanent Mission of Greece to the United Nations Office at Geneva transmitted the following communication to the Special Rapporteur: \"On 22 August 1991, the new Mufti of Xanthi, Mr. Mehmet Emin Sinikoglou, assumed his duties. Consequently, the interim mission of Mr. Mehmet Emin Aga, in charge after the death last year of Mufti Aga Mustafa, was terminated. However, Mr. Aga illegally refused to withdraw from the premises of the Office of the Mufti. He did so, only when health reasons (high blood pressure crisis) obliged him to be hospitalized, upon recommendation of medical doctors. The new Mufti, Mr. Emin Sinikoglou, born in 1939 in the village of Echinos (Xanthi) had studied for six years in the Islamic religious schools of Komotini and Recat. He later attended the High Theological School in the University of Medina, from which he graduated in 1971. Following these studies, he did post-graduate work at the University of Baghdad. Mr. Sinikoglou's selection as Mufti was conducted in implementation of Law 1920/4.2.1991 regarding 'Muslim Religious Ministers'. More specifically, the enlarged Committee consisting of Greek Muslim religious ministers and prominent Greek Muslim citizens had to examine the qualifications of the seven candidates. From among them, and upon the recommendation of the Committee, the Minister of Education and Religious Affairs finally selected one, namely Mr. Emin Sinikoglou, on the basis of his qualifications, personal and formal, to be appointed by presidential decree. The allegations contained in annex I of your letter, according to which a petition protesting this appointment and reportedly signed by all the religious leaders of the Muslim minority and submitted to the Parliament, are totally groundless. In this connection, it should be stressed that it is obviously with the participation of the Muslim element, as described above, that the Hellenic Republic appoints the religious minister of the prefecture, who, apart from religious jurisdiction, disposes of administrative competence towards the religious ministers in his region and judicial jurisdiction on issues of family and inheritance law as well. It is perhaps useful to recall that Greece is a country accepting the exercise of judicial jurisdiction by a Mufti. This very jurisdiction would suffer in case of designation of Muftis through popular election, harming thus their independence, as it would, inevitably, create and enhance a situation of political clientele. Such a designation would also jeopardize the principle of the functional and personal independence of the judge, a principle respected by most modern States. In countries where Muslims constitute the majority or live as a minority, Muftis are not elected. From Saudi Arabia to Turkey they are appointed by the State. To illustrate this, the recent nomination of several Muftis in Turkey should be mentioned. As to the events of 23 August 1991, I would like to inform you as follows: In the morning of 23 August 1991, a small number of Muslims from the mountainous area of Xanthi appeared on the streets of this town to contest Mr. Sinicoglou's taking office. In the afternoon of the same day, some 400 protesting Muslims held a sit-in. Later, in the evening, there were verbal altercations between young Muslims and Christians passing by, as well as some squabbling, but thanks to the decisive intervention of the police, the number of those slightly injured, both Christians and Muslims, was kept very low (13 persons). All of them were transported to the hospital and released the very same evening. Police authorities arrested two people who appeared to be leading the brawl and held them temporarily in custody. Public order in Xanthi was subsequently restored and no material damage was reported.\"",

On 19 November 1991 the Permanent Mission of India to the United Nations Office at Geneva transmitted the following information to the Special Rapporteur with regard to the above-mentioned allegations. \"At the outset, [the Permanent Mission] would like to mention that secularism constitutes the very foundation of India's democratic policy and the basis of India's unity in diversity. The right of freedom of religion is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed to all citizens by the Constitution of India. This includes the freedom of conscience and free profession, practice and propagation of religion and freedom to manage religious affairs. In India every religious denomination has the right to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes, to manage its own affairs in matters of religion, to own and acquire movable and immovable property and to administer such property in accordance with the law. The Government of India, has, moreover, repeatedly reaffirmed its commitment to secularism, the rule of law and the protection of the rights of religious freedom for all. Furthermore, the Indian Constitution enjoins that it is the fundamental duty of every citizen to promote harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood among all the peoples of India transcending religious, linguistic and regional or sectional diversities. Thus, India attempts to ensure that its citizens remain committed to tolerance and allow others of different faiths and persuasions to fully enjoy their rights and freedoms. The Government of India has also repeatedly enjoined upon civil servants and other public officials, including those entrusted with the maintenance of law and order to ensure that in the course of their official duty they fully respect different religions and beliefs and do not discriminate against persons professing other religions or beliefs. Despite the sincerity of the Government of India to preserve religious harmony, instances of communal violence have occasionally occurred. Sometimes these have been the result of the activities of misguided persons or anti-social elements; at other times they have resulted from misunderstandings and prejudices among members of different communities. However, even violent incidents involving adherents of two different religions do not stem from attempts to forcibly stop the practice of one religion by followers of another religion, but due to a multiplicity of other reasons, many of which are often local in nature. There are even instances when law and order situations have been deliberately given a communal flavour by local vested interests. Nonetheless, it is totally incorrect to think that the Government of India is in any way responsible for or even encouraged such communal incidents or that it brings them about because of any form of religious intolerance. As outlined earlier, the Government of India has a completely secular approach. Whenever incidents involving communal violence have regrettably taken place, it has acted swiftly to bring the situation under control and punish those found guilty. When governmental agencies anticipate such incidents, pre-emptive action is taken to ensure that communal and religious peace is not disturbed. In a country of over 800 million people belonging to a multitude of religious faiths - Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, Parsis, etc. - the maintenance of religious harmony is a daunting challenge; nonetheless, the challenge has been always met and tackled headlong. As regards the allegations conveyed vide paragraph 1 of the annex to your letter, it may be pointed out that the occurrence of incidents involving communal clashes cannot in any way justify that the Government be blamed for religious intolerance. Rather such incidents have taken place on account of factors outlined above. As regards the incidents at Ayodhya referred to, the police and paramilitary forces both acted to prevent any damage to the disputed structure there. In the action taken by the police and paramilitary forces on 30 October 1990 and 2 November 1990 in this regard, 16 persons including a member of the security forces lost their lives. The Permanent Mission wishes to add that while incidents of communal violence have taken place in India, the estimate of death toll being 'more that 5,000' as a result of communal violence since January 1990 is quite grossly exaggerated. It is also incorrect to suggest that most of those killed or injured belong to any particular faith. Furthermore, the police and other law and order maintenance authorities have done their best to contain communal clashes and prevent them from spreading. As regards the allegation contained in paragraph 2 of the annex to your letter, the allegation of discrimination against Christians is without basis.\" U9. In a communication sent on 1 November 1991 addressed to the Government of Indonesia, the following information was transmitted by the Special Rapporteur: \"According to the information received, followers of the Baha'i faith in Indonesia have been subjected to systematic persecution solely on the basis of their religious beliefs. It has been alleged that all Baha'i administrative institutions have been dissolved, all Baha'i schools closed and all of their properties, including a National Centre, have been confiscated. It has further been reported that members of the Baha'i community have been subjected to surveillance, arbitrary arrests and detention and that a number of Baha'is have been imprisoned from periods ranging from a few days up to five years. Their employment and promotion opportunities have reportedly also been restricted. It has been alleged that Baha'is have been pressured to renounce their faith and invited to adopt one of the five other religions recognized under the Constitution. Baha'is have allegedly been asked to formally renounce practising their faith, both privately and publicly and continue to not be allowed to pray even in the privacy of their own homes. Baha'i children are said to have been expelled from school and their books have been seized.\"",

        "Text": "50. In a communication sent on 20 May 1991 addressed to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the following information was transmitted by the Special Rapporteur: \"According to the information received, Reverend Hossein Soodmand (aged 55), an Iranian citizen of Christian faith who had converted from Islam, was executed on 3 December 1990 in Mashad because of his religious beliefs. It has been reported that Rev. Soodmand converted to Christianity more than 20 years ago, but was ordained as minister for the Assemblies of God church in Gorgan approximately two years ago. He is said to have previously been employed in the Iranian Bible Society, in a Christian hospital in Isfahan and a mission for the blind. It has been alleged that Rev. Soodmand was first arrested and blindfolded, and subsequently interrogated in September 1990 in Gorgan, where he was to become pastor since the church he served in Mashad was reportedly closed on governmental orders in 1988. He was reportedly imprisoned for 28 days. Upon release he allegedly returned to his home town, Mashad, where he is said to have been re-arrested and interrogated, and was imprisoned for an additional 28 days. It has been alleged that during this incarceration, Rev. Soodmand was physically tortured. It has further been reported that when Rev. Soodmand returned to Gorgan, he was arrested once again and ordered to return to Mashad. In Mashad, he was arrested for the fourth time and imprisoned on charges of apostasy from Islam, propagating Christianity, disseminating Christian literature and establishing an illegal church. It has been reported that Rev. Soodmand was subjected to both psychological and physical torture and ill-treatment while in custody for refusing to recant his faith. According to the sources, Rev. Hossein Soodmand was hanged in Mashad on 3 December 1990. It is not known whether he was tried or, if this were the case, whether the trial conformed to internationally accepted standards of a fair trial. Rev. Soodmand's family was reportedly not accorded visitation rights and was not informed of his situation until after the execution had taken place. It has also been alleged that his body was not released for burial, although a number of pastors in Mashad were reportedly shown a coroner's report indicating that Rev. Soodmand was dead. He is said not to have been buried in a cemetery but a location described as unsuitable for a respectful burial. According to additional information received, Mehdi Debadj, an Iranian citizen of Christian faith who had converted from Islam approximately 25 years ago, has been imprisoned since 1983 because of his religious beliefs. Mr. Debadj, who is a Bible teacher and translator, was reportedly arrested in 1983 and detained in Babol, had been released temporarily when the church paid \\$US 20,000 as security. He is said to have been re-arrested shortly thereafter and subjected to torture in order that he may renounce his faith. It has been alleged that since his re-arrest and incarceration Mr. Debadj has been transferred from prison to prison throughout the country. It has also been alleged that his children, who have to rely on other persons for support, were last allowed to visit him months ago and that his whereabouts have been unknown since that time. It is also not known whether Mr. Debadj is still alive. I also received several reports alleging that the Government has required all Christian churches to re-register after the Parliament had approved the recognition of churches through re-registration six years ago. It has been alleged that the Assemblies of God churches have submitted all the documents necessary for re-registration more than three years ago but have still not been able to register. The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance reportedly closed in July 1989 the Christian training centre Garden of Evangelism in Tehran which had been used for pastoral training for over 45 years. It is also reported that the same Ministry closed the Christian church in Sari, northern Iran, in 1988 and that its pastor had been forced to leave the city. In addition, it has been alleged that several Christian churches and bookstores have been closed, that Christian conferences have been prohibited and that the Government has to authorize the performing of Christian weddings and church outings. Authorities are said to have urged Iranian citizens of Christian faith 'not to contact the West'. It has been reported that the Government had interfered in the work of the Iranian Bible Society before it was closed by not allowing it to send its annual report to churches within the country. It is said to have also prohibited the import of Bibles in the Persian language as well as the use of words 'Son of God or 'Lord' to refer to Jesus Christ, only allowing that he be designated by the word 'Prophet'. According to additional information received, many Christians who had converted from the Muslim faith are said to have been repeatedly threatened with imprisonment or imprisoned, notably in Ahwaz. It has been reported that the pastor of the Assemblies of God church in Ahwaz had been arrested and imprisoned in 1987 for one month and was subsequently taken to Tehran where he was obliged to report once a week to the Komiteh. The pastor who replaced him is said to have also been arrested and imprisoned and made to leave for Tehran. The Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance reportedly closed the church and its property was confiscated. It has been alleged that on 7 December 1990 the pastor of the 'Injili' Presbyterian Church in Tabriz was arrested and is detained in Tabriz prison. The 'Injili' Church has reportedly also not been able to re-register. It has also been alleged that another Christian belonging to the Niloo Church in Tehran who had converted from the Muslim faith was imprisoned for one month in September 1990. Both persons were reportedly tortured and are said to have recanted their faith in writing. They were allegedly released from prison when they adopted Islam.\"",

        "Text": "51. In a communication sent on 31 October 1991 addressed to the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the following information was transmitted by the Special Rapporteur: According to the information received, Baha'is are said to still officially be considered as 'unprotected infidels' and are denied legal recognition. It has furthermore been reported that, although there has been some improvement in individual circumstances of members of the Baha'i religious community in recent years, it would appear that a systematic violation of their rights solely on the basis of their religious beliefs continues. It has been reported that the opportunities of Baha'is in both the public and private sector continue to be restricted. The economic and social discrimination ranges from dismissal from Government employment, orders to return salaries received as public employees, suspension of salary or pension payments, invalidation of work permits, denial of unemployment benefits, confiscation of ration booklets, denial of participation in social welfare activities, inability to enforce business contracts, collect insurance or qualify to inherit family properties. It has been alleged that Baha'is are not allowed officially to open their own businesses and Baha'i farmers are said to not be admitted to farmers' cooperatives which would enable them to obtain agricultural credits, seeds, pesticide and fertilizer. It has also been reported that numerous private and business properties such as houses and farms have been arbitrarily confiscated and sold at government auctions or put up for sale, most recently in the city of Yazd, without any consideration of the appeals of the Baha'is concerned. A number of widows and elderly persons are said to have been evicted from their homes. Many Baha'i-owned administrative centres, holy places, historical sites, cemeteries and other assets continue to be confiscated or have been destroyed. As a religious community, Baha'is reportedly continue to be regarded as members of the 'misguided Baha'i sect', are denied [the right] to freely express their religious beliefs, the right of assembly and the right to maintain their religious administrative institutions. Baha'is are allowed to assemble only in limited numbers in private homes. All community property such as places of worship allegedly remains confiscated, they are not allowed to elect their leaders or organize administrative institutions to govern community affairs or operate religious schools. In January 1991, members of the Baha'i faith in Karaj, Mashhad, Sari and other cities were notified by the Ministry of Security and Information to stop educating their children in Baha'i spiritual and moral values and such classes were reportedly closed throughout the country by mid-January. It has been alleged that Baha'is continue to be imprisoned because of their religion and that over 40 individual Baha'is were detained for periods from 12 hours to 120 days in 1990. In June 1991, three persons were arrested in Shiraz for refusing to promise that the Baha'i community in that city would cease to practice its faith. Thirty-one Baha'is were reportedly detained during the first six months of 1991 and the following five Baha'is were allegedly imprisoned as of 15 September 1991: - 1. Mr. Muhammad Dihgan (Shiraz) - 2. Mr. Habibu'llah Hakimi (Shiraz) - 3. Mr. Bakhshu'llah Mithaqi (Karaj labour camp) - 4. Mr. Kayvan Khalajabadi (either in Gohardasht-Karaj or Evin-Tehran) - 5. Mr. Bihnam Mithaqi (either in Gohardasht-Karaj or Evin-Tehran) Baha'i marriages and divorces are allegedly not legally recognized and Baha'i children have difficulties in obtaining legal documents and inheritance as a result of being considered as illegitimate and are deprived of the right to inheritance from Muslim parents or relatives. Baha'is are said to be denied access to colleges and universities and cannot be employed by university faculties. When applying for passports, Baha'is are reportedly treated rudely and are invited orally to recant their religion in order to obtain a new passport or have their current ones renewed or extended. It has been alleged that out of 380 applications for passports by Baha'is in 1990, only 61 passports had been issued, mostly to sick and elderly persons. No passports were allegedly issued to Baha'is since March 1991 and 400 applications were awaiting to be processed as of June 1991. Followers of the Baha'i faith are reportedly experiencing difficulties in burying their dead in Babul, Babulsar, Chalus, Hamadan, Sari and many other cities. It has been alleged that numerous Baha'i cemeteries have been destroyed or desecrated and that graves have been destroyed while tombstones were removed and sold. It has been reported that two schools have been built in a section of the Baha'i cemetery in Tehran and that the construction of additional buildings in the same cemetery is planned. The following specific cases and incidents have been reported: The appeal of Mr. Abdul-ali Yazdani from Tehran to receive compensation for his dismissal from the Vahid Autobus Company due to the fact that he is a Baha'i was reportedly turned down by the Committee of the Department of Employment Disputes of the Ministry of Employment and Social Affairs, in confirmation of the verdict of 23 January 1990, in view of the fact that working relations are severed with the members of this sect and that he himself has explicitly admitted that he is a Baha'i. Mrs. Nayyirih Gandum-Pakkun, a schoolteacher who had been employed by the Ministry of Education, District 5 of Isfahan Province, was reportedly sentenced to permanent dismissal from government offices/services and was charged with 'membership in the misguided Baha'i sect'. The Civil Council for Investigation of Administrative Offences of the Department of Education for Isfahan Province found 'that her guilt is established according to Section 2, Act 19 of the law of the Council of Administrative Offences ... on the basis of the fact that Mrs. Gandum-Pakkun herself admits to being a member of the misguided sect of Baha'ism and is even proud of it' and the verdict of her permanent dismissal from government services was unanimously confirmed. It has been reported that on 17 October 1990, the Civil Council for Investigation of Administrative Offences of the Ministry of Education in Mazandaran Province unanimously decided that Mrs. Varqa'iyyih Talibi, a teacher from Sari, be sentenced to permanent dismissal from government services in view of the fact that, in a letter dated 6 October 1990, 'the accused confirms that she is a member of the misguided Baha'i sect and in the letters addressed to this Council as well as to the headquarters, this fact is personally emphasized by her. On 30 October 1990, Mr. Hadi Gurji Mahfurujaki received a confirmation of his sentence 'to permanent dismissal from government employment as a result of his membership in the misguided Baha'i sect' and his subsequent complaint for nullification of the verdict was also rejected. The Ministry of Justice reportedly indicated that his petition '... was rejected on the grounds of being out of date, and considering the fact that Baha'ism is a belief against God and human dignity, and as with reference to petition dated 30 June 1990, he has clearly stated that he is a member of the misguided Baha'i sect, and further as it is not befitting for the sacred order of the Islamic Republic of Iran which has come into being through the shedding of the blood of hundreds of thousands of sacrificial and godly people, to keep as its member such an individual who openly announces his membership of a sect which is against the sacred order of the Islamic Republic, and considering the fact that a decision has already been made and the verdict of the Court of Administrative Justice is final, his complaint is therefore legally groundless'. In view of the verdict issued by the Reviewing Committee of the Manpower Section of the Ministry of Health, the Department of Social Security informed Mrs. Kayhandukt Thabitiyan from Babul on 28 October 1990 that, since 'the late Mr. Manuchihr Dirakhshaniyan was sentenced to permanent dismissal from service in all government offices (as a result of his membership of the misguided Baha'i sect), the payment of his pension to his survivors is not legally permissible'. In a letter dated 19 September 1989, Mr. Derakhshanyan had been informed by the Department of Social Security that as 'you are permanently dismissed from employment by the government or any governmental agency (on the basis of the allegation of your belonging to the misguided sect of Baha'ism). Therefore, payment of your retirement pension is not legally permissible. According to the sources, Mr. Hayat Afshar from Ahvaz, a retired employee of the National Oil Company was denied his past and present pension payments since, 'Due to his membership in the misguided sect of Baha'ism, ... Mr. Hayat Afshar is permanently dismissed from government employment, and according to the regulations issued by the Council for Investigating Administrative Offences on 16 March 1986, employees who have not yet submitted an appeal do not have the right to do so any longer.' Mr. Hossein Fateri was informed by the Forestry Department on 19 March 1991 that 'we would like to inform you that the discontinuation of your pension payments was based on the recommendation of the Reforming Council of the Ministry of Agriculture and in execution of the instructions received from the previous Minister of the Department of Agriculture which was issued on 3 June 1981 the reason for which is your membership in the misguided Baha'i sect. In view of the facts mentioned above, therefore, your pension payments can in no way be restored'. The Civil Court of Abadih informed Mr. Azizu'llah Gulzar who registered a complaint in an exchange transaction, that 'the Civil Court of Abadih states that transactions with members of the Baha'i sect are not valid'. According to the information received, the Public Prosecutor of Karaj issued a 'verdict for the acquittance of the accused (Mr. Seyed Asadu'llah Kumayzi, accused of the unintentional murder of his cousin as a result of his negligence in driving) from the payment of the blood-money' to the family of the deceased since, 'according to the statement of the accused and the immediate family of the victim, Firaydun Kumayzi, was a Baha'i. The family has clearly indicated this fact, and it has been registered by the Court. The rest of his family are also followers of this sect. Even if they were to announce their belief in Islam, they would still be considered heretics because according to their belief, another Prophet, Baha'u'llah, has appeared after His Holiness Mohammad, which is sufficient evidence for them to be condemned to infidelity. Therefore, as the infidelity of the late Firaydun Kumayzi is evident to this Court, ...' In addition, it has been indicated that 'If guilt had been proven, application of the 'equality' clause No. 12 ... of the Supreme Court of Appeal, the 'religious blood-money' (Shariah law or canonical law), could have been applied. (This however does not apply in this case because the murdered did not deserve it. This law does not apply to infidels...) ' According to additional information received, followers of the Zoroastrian faith, which is one of the four religions officially recognized by the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran, have on occasion been subjected to persecution such as harassment, torture and ill-treatment, kidnapping, arbitrary arrests, imprisonment without charges or trial, denial of passports, closing of businesses and denial of employment, attending compulsory classes in Islamic ideology, forcible conversion to Islam and marriage to persons not belonging to the Zoroastrian faith. According to the information received, members of the Assyrian community, another of the four officially recognized religions, are being harassed and threatened with imprisonment in Orumiyeh, West Azerbeyjan. Assyrian shopkeepers allegedly have to display signs in their shop windows indicating their religious faith, which has entailed a decline in their sales.\" Iraq",

        "Text": "52. In a communication sent on 11 June 1991 addressed to the Government of Iraq, the following information was transmitted by the Special Rapporteur: \"According to the information received, the Shia Muslim community in Iraq has been subjected over the past decade to various practices inconsistent with the provisions of the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief. In particular, it has been alleged that institutions of religious education have been systematically destroyed and religious leaders and scholars persecuted and killed. The Special Rapporteur has received allegations that in the course of recent months, the Shia Muslim community has suffered particular discrimination and that an estimated 20,000 persons were recently killed in the cities of Karbala and Najaf within the framework of an anti-Government uprising which had erupted among the Shia population at the end of the Gulf war. It has also been alleged that the 1,000-year-old universities of Najaf and Karbala have recently been closed down, while the Dar-al-Hikma, Qaswini and Seleemiya schools have sustained significant damage. The Al-Khoei school, located opposite the Imam Ali shrine in Najaf, was said to have been razed to the ground. According to the sources, it is estimated that some 800 members of the clergy (300 teachers and 500 students) have recently been rounded up in the holy cities of Karbala and Najaf and are currently missing. It is feared that many have been executed. The fate of their families, including women and children, is also said to be unknown. It is estimated that the total number of the clergy and their families is 5,000 in Najaf alone. It has been reported that all the religious scholars in the holy cities have either been killed or arrested and that a certain number had been shot in the street. This is reportedly the case of 65-year-old Sheikh Ali Ashgar Ahmadi. The Special Rapporteur has also been informed that the traditional call to prayer and pilgrimage to the holy shrines in Karbala and Najaf, which contains the tenets of Shia Islam, have been banned. The holy shrines of Shia Islam are said to have recently been desecrated, to have sustained considerable damage and to have been sealed off from worshippers. Public prayers are also said to have been banned. It has further been alleged that valuable religious books from a number of libraries have been burnt. The Special Rapporteur has received additional allegations affirming that a number of distinguished Afghan religious scholars who were residing in the cities of Kaazmin, Karbala and Najaf have either been killed or arrested. It is feared that those in detention are being subjected to torture. It has been reported that on 20 March 1991 government forces carried out an armed raid on the traditional residence in Kufa, near the holy city of Najaf, of the Imam, Grand Ayatollah as-Sayyid Abul Qasim Al-Khoei (aged 95). According to the information received, the attack resulted in the death of numerous religious scholars, civilians from among the Imam's followers, and a considerable number of his guards. It has been alleged that on that occasion, the Grand Ayatollah was arrested together with his aides (eight religious scholars) and 10 members of his family (his daughter, son, daughter-in-law and seven grandchildren aged from three to 11). He is said to have been forced to walk over the dead bodies of his guards to the helicopter that transported him to Baghdad, where he was allegedly confined in a specially prepared detention centre. The Grand Ayatollah subsequently appeared in a television interview which is said to have been conducted under duress. The Grand Ayatollah is said to have spoken in a low, weak and halting voice and appeared short of breath. While in captivity, he was reportedly subjected to severe mental torture and is said to have subsequently appeared exhausted and distressed. The Special Rapporteur has received copies of certificates with the diagnoses of two doctors who have both stated that the Grand Ayatollah's condition had obviously deteriorated between the videos taken in Baghdad and Kufa and that he required urgent medical care, which was allegedly denied. Requests for transfer abroad for medical treatment have reportedly also been refused. The Grand Ayatollah is said to have been brought back to Kufa on 23 March 1991. Upon his return to Kufa, the Grand Ayatollah, who was in the habit of receiving Shia Muslims from all over the world, is reported to have been placed under house arrest and is allegedly no longer allowed to receive visitors, while his residence is said to be surrounded by armed men. It has also been reported that the Grand Ayatullah's son, Sayyid Muhammad Taghi Al-Khoei, the only member of his family allowed to see him, is also under house arrest with his father. Requests for relatives to see the Grand Ayatollah in view of his state of health are said to have been turned down. A number of other relatives are said to still be detained and there is no news of their whereabouts. As the movements of the Grand Ayatollah, who is Rector of the Theology Centre of Najaf and has supervized advanced post-graduate studies for the past 50 years are restricted, teaching at this institution has reportedly come to a standstill. The following eight aides to the Grand Ayatollah were arrested with him and are reportedly still under detention: Sayyid Mohammad Reza Mousavi al-Khalkhali Sayyid Ja'far Bahrul Uloom Sayyid 'Izzaddin Bahrul Uloom Sayyid Muhyaddin al-Ghuraif Sayyid Muhammad Ridha al-Kharsan Sayyid Muhammad al-Sabzwari Sayyid Muhammad Ridha al-Sa'idi Sayyid Muhammad Saleh 'Abd al-Rasul al-Kharsan. The first three of the above-mentioned religious scholars are believed to be detained at an undisclosed location in Baghdad. The whereabouts and fate of the other five have been unknown since 21 March 1991. It is feared that some may have been killed or that they are being subjected to torture and risk execution. The Special Rapporteur has also received allegations concerning the detention of another senior Grand Ayatollah, Sayyid Abdul al-Sabzwari, the father of Sayyid Muhammad al-Sabzwari mentioned above. It has been reported that he is over 75 years old and is known to be in bad health.\"",

        "Text": "54. On 8 August 1991 the following reply to the above-mentioned accusations was transmitted to the Special Rapporteur from the Government of Iraq: \"The competent Iraqi authorities have taken note of your letter dated 11 June 1991, addressed to Ambassador Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, Permanent Representative of the Republic of Iraq to the United Nations Office at Geneva, and its annexes, concerning the allegations that you have received in regard to the so-called 'situation of the Shia Muslim community in Iraq. The Iraqi authorities, while diligently studying the details of the incidents in question with a view to ascertaining and making known the true facts in a fully objective manner, wish to take this opportunity to express their appreciation for the concern that you have shown for this matter and for the opportunity that you have given to the competent Iraqi authorities to establish the facts and state their point of view. It is well known that Iraq is the cradle of human civilization which, over the centuries, has made a major contribution to the heritage of mankind as a whole. In view of the disasters and foreign occupations to which it has been subjected for several centuries, Iraq would obviously not have been able to make such a contribution but for the humanitarian values and principles which were formulated and developed in its territory and among its people. However, this is not surprising since Iraq is a peaceful country in which religious and moral concepts, principles and ideals have coexisted in a fraternal atmosphere that enabled them to flourish, develop and interact with the noble values of the civilizations of other peoples and nations. In the light of this historical fact and Iraq's time-honoured civilization, any person concerned with this matter will find it fairly easy to understand the real situation in regard to the social and religious composition of the Iraqi people, which is based on mutual understanding, brotherhood, interaction and endeavours to consolidate the humanitarian links between the various religions, communities and minorities that are coexisting in Iraq. This situation should constitute the basis for any dialogue concerning the matter raised in your letter. Accordingly, we wish to state the following:",

The Iraqi Government, represented by its competent authorities, is diligently endeavouring to preserve and develop religious centres with a view to promoting religious teachings and the humanitarian values that they comprise. This is a self-evident and incontrovertible fact which cannot be disregarded and official policy in regard to all the various types of religious institutions cannot be influenced by extraneous events and recent developments. That policy is in conformity with article 19 of the Iraqi Constitution, which stipulates that \"All citizens are equal before the law, without discrimination on grounds of sex, race, language, social origin or religion\". Article 25 of the Constitution further stipulates that \"Freedom of religion, belief and religious observance is guaranteed\".",

In the wake of the aggression by the coalition forces led by the United States of America, after the ceasefire some Iraqi towns fell prey to disturbances, consisting in acts of aggression against persons and official, religious, social and educational institutions, as well as places of worship. The precious cultural and historical contents of those institutions, including religious and other manuscripts and books, were burnt and destroyed and innocent citizens were subjected to all forms of plunder, murder and sexual assault during those disturbances, which caused widespread devastation and a breakdown of public order and security, as a result of which the lives and property of citizens were threatened. The competent authorities fulfilled their duty by suppressing those disturbances and subversive acts in order to put an end to the state of anarchy, protect public order and security, restore the rule of law and prevent any further violations thereof. Those acts were manifestly instigated by foreign parties outside Iraq, which supplied their perpetrators with funds, weapons and personnel with a view to completing the second phase of the treacherous aggression to which Iraq was subjected, consisting in the destruction of its remaining socio-economic infrastructure.",

The acts of subversion and aggression continued for several days before the competent official authorities were able to regain control and restore order and security in all aspects of daily life at the locations in which those criminal acts had been committed. In addition to the extensive material damage which they caused, those acts also took a heavy toll of lives among innocent citizens, regardless of their beliefs and religious affiliations, and also among the police and security forces and the subversives and infiltrators themselves. In fact, the subversives converted places of worship and official and religious institutions into headquarters in which they installed their command posts and in which they engaged in the most abominable acts of torture, murder and rape against innocent citizens who refused to collaborate with them. Through their information media and their numerous links with well-known foreign bodies, the parties instigating those acts against the security of Iraq attempted to offset their failure to achieve their objectives, while maintaining their aggressive and iniquitous policy towards Iraq by endeavouring to bring Iraq into disrepute through allegations concerning the so-called 'situation of the Shia Muslim community' in Iraq and the practices and ill-treatment to which they are purportedly being subjected by the Iraqi authorities concerned.",

        "ID": 4,
        "Text": "4. In reply to the allegations contained in the annex to your letter, we wish to clarify the following points: (a) The annex alleges that the 'Shia Muslim community in Iraq has been subjected over the past decade to various practices inconsistent with the provisions of the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination based on Religion or Belief. The fact that this matter has been raised at the present time indicates an attempt to distort and conceal the truth and draw attention to past periods in which such allegations were not made.; (b) At the present time, it should be noted that about 500 persons were killed as a result of aggression and terrorism by saboteurs in the governorates of Karbala and Najaf. Moreover, many of those subversives were also killed or fled during the campaign to remove them from those two governorates.; (c) Mention was also made of the closure of the 1,000-year-old universities of Najaf and Karbala. In actual fact, Karbala has no Islamic university of that name; it merely has ordinary theological colleges that are below university standard. These colleges still exist and enjoy the protection and care of the State; religious classes are being held therein and none of them has been closed. There is a college, known as Najaf University, which is run by Muhammad Sultan Kalantar, a minister of religion, and in which classes are still being held in a normal manner. The al-Hikma theological college, which was built several years ago and was run by the al-Hakim family, was taken over by the aggressive subversives who used it as a command post, a prison and a place for the execution of innocent civilians. Consequently, that college suffered severe material damage and is currently being repaired and restored.; The Qazwiniya and Saleemiya colleges still exist and have not suffered any damage. It should be noted that the al-Khoei college, which is situated opposite the Imam Ali shrine, is in one of the areas covered by the project for the development and expansion of the Haidari courtyard. The college building was therefore expropriated, with the agreement of His Eminence the Imam, in return for fair compensation before the acts of aggression and subversion to which Iraq was subjected. (d) With regard to the question of the university and the colleges in the governorates of Karbala and Najaf, it should also be noted that the city of Kufa has a university named after it. However, since its buildings and their contents were severely damaged as a result of the acts of aggression and sabotage, the competent authorities were obliged to transfer that university to the city of Hilla pending the completion of the repairs to the damaged buildings, after which the university will be transferred back to Kufa.; (e) Concerning the allegation that a large number of clergymen, teachers and students were rounded up in the cities of Karbala and Najaf and are currently missing, what actually happened was that 20 clergymen, with their families and children, sought refuge with the competent authorities and requested their protection during the acts of sabotage in view of their fear of being attacked by the saboteurs. They were provided with health care and appropriate accommodation and were subsequently returned safely to their homes and places of residence, at their own request, after the acts of sabotage had been suppressed. They included Muhammad Kalantar and his children, who are currently living in the city of Najaf. No clergymen have been detained in the city of Karbala.; In this connection, it must be emphasized that the Iraqi Government has always treated the clergymen of all religious communities with all due respect for their religious and social status. We can confirm that the clergymen in the governorates of Najaf and Karbala are still discharging their religious duties and leading completely normal lives without any harassment. The competent Iraqi authorities have no knowledge of any clergyman bearing the name of Sheikh Ali Ashqar Ahmadi living in Iraq or within the boundaries of the governorate of Najaf or any other governorate. (f) As a result of the acts of sabotage and aggression, the holy shrines at Karbala and Najaf suffered severe material damage. The competent Iraqi authorities, being eager to restore them to their normal state, have begun to repair the numerous damaged parts, which has necessitated their temporary closure to visitors so that they can be reconstructed and restored.; (g) Except as already indicated in paragraph (f) above, no form of prohibition has been imposed on the call to prayer or on visits to the holy shrines which are centres of pilgrimage for Muslims of all religious confessions.; (h) With regard to the allegations concerning Afghan religious scholars residing in Iraq, we wish to emphasize that very few of them are residing at Karbala and Kadhimiya, although a larger number are living at Najaf. They are leading perfectly normal religious lives and enjoying the protection, care and respect of the Iraqi authorities in their capacity as guests of Iraq.; (i) When the acts of sabotage and aggression occurred, His Eminence Ayatollah al-Khoei and his son, Muhammad Taqi al-Khoei, requested an audience with the President of the Republic in order to express their condemnation of the acts of sedition. They were granted an audience which was broadcast by Baghdad television and other radio stations. The Imam's request to speak on television was granted and he repeated his condemnation of the acts of sabotage and sedition. The full text, as well as the video recording, of the audience are annexed to our letter.; His Eminence and his son also met foreign journalists at his place of residence in the city of Najaf. (j) We wish to emphasize that neither Ayatollah al-Khoei nor any member of his family has been subjected to any form of constraint, detention, influence, pressure, coercion or house arrest. It is noteworthy that Ayatollah Abul Qasim al-Khoei is over 90 years of age and is therefore suffering from symptoms of ill-health. However, the State medical authorities are looking after his health, which is being periodically monitored by medical specialists.; His Eminence Ayatollah Abul Qasim al-Khoei has not expressed any desire to leave Iraq for purposes of medical treatment and is freely receiving visitors. His most recent visitor was Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, the United Nations Coordinator of Humanitarian Assistance. (k) Ayatollah al-Khoei's eight aides named in the note were not subjected to any form of detention and the information available to us indicates that Sayyid Muhammad Sabzwari is currently in Iran.; Sayyid Muhammad Taqi al-Khoei, Sayyid Muhammad Ridha al-Khurasan and Sayyid Muhammad Salih Abd al-Rasoul al-Khurasan are living in the city of Najaf. At the present time, we have no information concerning the others, although the competent authorities are conducting the requisite inquiries.",

We wish to take this opportunity to express our appreciation for the noble humanitarian task that you are discharging, as well as our willingness to reply to any questions that you might wish to raise.

        "Text": "55. On 4 November 1991 a further letter was sent by the Special Rapporteur to the Government of Iraq, as follows: \"According to the information received, the Shia Muslim community has been and continues to be subjected to practices inconsistent with the provisions of the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, which jeopardize its religious identity and heritage. The systematic destruction of the majority of mosques, Husseiniyas (religious gathering places for commemorating the martyrdom of Iman Hussein), religious schools, libraries, cemeteries and other historic sites in the holy cities of Najaf and Kerbala has been reported. Numerous cemeteries and graveyards are said to have been desecrated and razed and burials have allegedly been prohibited in many of these facilities. The principal public libraries and private collections, some of which contained rare religious books, manuscripts and other valuable objects, were reportedly looted and many among them burnt. It has been alleged that entire sections of towns and cities with a predominantly Shia population as well as the structures surrounding the holy shrines have been demolished with a view to changing their character. It has also been reported that the perimeter walls of the holy shrines which contain historic examples of ancient Islamic art and crafts are to be destroyed and replaced with iron bars, and that plans exist to build public parks around them. It has further been alleged that the holy shrines have also been looted and that their administration has been taken away from the Shia religious authorities and entrusted to those of the State. It has reportedly been envisaged to convert a number of holy shrines into museums, which would take away the spiritual and social role they play in the life of the Shia community. In addition, the construction and funding of new Shia mosques and meeting places is reportedly subjected to enormous legal and administrative obstacles. Religious leaders at the mosques are reportedly chosen by the authorities and the content of their speeches is monitored. They are said to be frequently harassed and restricted in their movements within and outside the country. Worshippers are allegedly also subjected to surveillance and intimidation by security officers. It has further been alleged that the movements of the Grand Ayatollah as-Sayyid Abul Qasim Al-Khoei, whose health is said to be deteriorating, remain restricted and that pressure is being exerted on him to appear on television and send envoys to official ceremonies. The members of his family, staff and their relatives who were arrested in March 1991 continue to be detained at undisclosed locations and more than 800 members of the clergy and religious scholars who had been rounded up in Kerbala and Najaf remain in incommunicado detention. Those who are not detained are said to have been prohibited from performing their religious duties and wearing their traditional dress. It has been alleged that there are currently only 15 religious scholars left in Najaf. Numerous religious schools, colleges and universities have allegedly been destroyed and closed. Many seminars are said to have been banned with the exception of those which have been officially approved. In addition, the official curriculum of the state school system allegedly only teaches the Sunni creed despite the fact that the majority of school children belong to the Shia faith. Information campaigns against the Shia faith accusing it of deviation and heresy have also been reported. Religious affairs units allegedly control the publishing of both contemporary and traditional works of Shia literature^as well as any books and magazines, while religious programmes with a Shia content cannot be broadcast on radio and television. It has been alleged that more than 1,000 Shia religious book titles have been banned by the Ministry of Information. Traditional Shia rituals concerning the Iman Hussein are said to have been completely prohibited, both in private and in public, as is also the case with other public manifestations and processions associated with Shia religious holidays, the majority of which are allegedly not officially recognized. It has further been reported that the application of the Shia law regarding personal and family matters such as marriage and inheritance is not permitted. Discrimination concerning employment opportunities and promotion of members of the Shia community is said to exist, particularly in the civil service, judiciary and the military. It has also been alleged that the current Nationality Law has resulted in hundreds of thousands of members of the Shia community having their citizenship revoked. It has further been reported that hundreds of thousands of Shia have been deported and their property seized with no compensation. Threats against the Grand Ayatollah's son, Sayyid Muhammad Taghi Al-Khoei, are said to have recently appeared in the \"Alqadisiya\" newspaper, which is published by the Ministry of Defence. A series of six articles which attacked and ridiculed the Shia faith are reported to have recently appeared in the Ath Thawra newspaper. Derogatory remarks are said to have been made concerning the appearance, religious rites and morals of the Shias and doubts were allegedly expressed concerning the validity of Shia marriages, implying that the children may be illegitimate. The following allegations of destruction in the Shia holy cities of Iraq in March 1991 in the context of repression which followed the Shia uprising have been received: The following Shia holy shrines and places of worship have reportedly been destroyed or badly damaged in the city of Najaf On 23 March 1991, a bulldozer is said to have been brought in through the Toosi door in order to tear a large hole in the air conditioning duct? through which it passed into the inner courtyard. A number of children who reportedly sought refuge in the shrine were hurled into a crowd outside and most are said to have died as a result. It has further been alleged that the tomb of the Imam Ali suffered extensive damage after being hit by artillery shells and that one of the silver panels surrounding the tomb was also destroyed. The golden dome and the main building are also said to have sustained considerable damage, as is the case with the main door and minaret; - 2. Forty to fifty persons are said to have been burnt alive by napalm bombing in the holy shrine located in the Huwaish district of Najaf; - 3. The Imam Zain Al Abideen shrine dating back to the Islamic 7th century has been damaged; - 4. The Safi Safa shrine in Zain Al Abideen Street has also been damaged. It has also been alleged that the golden dome of the Muslim bin Aqeel holy shrine in the centre of Kufa has been badly damaged by artillery fire. - 1. The Imam Ali mosque in Amir district - 2. The Baquee'a mosque in Medina Street - 3. The Morad mosque in Toosi Street - 4. The Sami Kirmasha mosque in Imarah district - 5. The Imam Sadiq mosque in Medina Street - 6.

Paragraph 3 of the same article indicates how it is to be understood so as to guard against any misinterpretation, stating that the freedom to profess one's religion or beliefs must not be incompatible with the need for protection, security, order and public health, morality or the fundamental freedoms and rights of others. It thus follows that by virtue of its Constitution, which is its supreme text, Morocco is an Islamic State, and consequently that it is impossible that Mr. Suleimani should have been arrested for his religious opinions, given that he too is a Muslim. On the other hand, in Morocco, as in all other countries, the establishment of associations and their activities are governed by law (dahir of 15 November 1958 regulating the right of association). The association mentioned by Mr. Suleimani has not been recognized, and hence, its existence not having been authorized, any activity undertaken under its auspices is liable to give rise to legal proceedings, particularly when such activities affect security, law and order, or the fundamental freedoms and rights of others. The international texts on human rights, and in particular the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, contain quite specific provisions on this point.

The matter was deliberated upon in the legislature and consensus of the nation was arrived in shape of an amendment in the Constitution through a unanimous vote of the National Assembly in 1974. This amendment had two objects viz: (a) To safeguard the religious sentiments of Muslims (the overwhelming majority of the population);; (b) To protect the Ahmadis from any adverse reaction arising from what had been historically regarded as a repudiation of a fundamental belief of the Muslims.",

        "Text": "12. Islam enjoins the most tolerant treatment of minorities. In his farewell address to his followers, the Prophet of Islam (Peace Be Upon Him) said that on the Day of Judgement he would bear witness on behalf of the minorities. Therefore, for Muslims religious tolerance is not merely a moral obligation but a religious duty. A thousand years in history, when Islam was in political ascendancy, bear testimony to this tolerance and coexistence with minorities. In any event, it would be quite clear to anyone familiar with the true situation in Pakistan, that there exist no plan or campaign, official or otherwise, to persecute the Ahmadi community.\" The incident took place due to the alleged burning of the Holy Quran by an Ahmadi on 10 April 1989 in Chak No. 563/GB, Tehsil Jaranwala, Distt. Faisalabad. Chak No. 563/GB is only 5-6 miles from Nankana Sahib and repercussions were feared there as well, and the local administration spared no effort to pre-empt the situation. The Assistant Commissioner, Nankana Sahib and [a] subdivisional police officer held a meeting of local respectables on 11 April 1989 to discuss the issue. All the participants assured that although a procession [would] be taken out by them on 12 April 1989 to voice their resentment over the burning of the Holy Quran, they [would] however, remain peaceful. But unfortunately, the [participants in the] procession, who were joined by local college students, ran riot and resorted to vandalism. The procession went unruly and damaged a Qadiani place of worship. The warning administered by the Assistant Commissioner, Nankana Sahib was not heeded by the rioters, whereupon tear-gas shells were fired. The mob dispersed into splinter groups and started burning the household articles of about 12-13 Qadianis located in the city. More tear-gas shells were fired to disperse the hooligans. The local administration saved the lives of several Qadianis by retrieving them from the houses. However, 15 houses of Qadianis were partly damaged and nine policemen, including DSP/SDPO, injured. Rioters were chased and 59 of them were arrested. Two cases, FIR No. 123 and 124/89 dated 12 April 1989, under sections 308/452/332/353/39/397/506/436/148/149/PPC, were registered at the Nankana Sahib police station for investigation and trial in the court of law. There existed acute tension between Ahmadis and Muslims in village Chak Sikandar No. 30 about a dispute over a mosque and a daira (public combined place) of the village. The dispute was resolved by the area magistrate and the possession of the mosque was delivered to the Muslims. During May 1989, however, a rift was again created in the village following the visit of an Ahmadi scholar. On 16 July 1989, one Ghulam Haider was passing in the street along with Ahmad Khan, Fateh Ali, Abdul Rehman and Muhammad Asghar when 28 Ahmadis armed with firearms committed murderous assault on them. The armed Ahmadis resorted to indiscriminate firing as a result of which Ahmad Ali (Muslim) died on the spot, while Muhammad Asghar and Fateh Ali were seriously injured. In addition to this the accused Ahmadis also set on fire the house and belongings of Khalid Hussain, Adalat Khan and Abdul Ghafoor. In retaliation for the aggressive steps taken by the Ahmadis, the Muslims of the area also gathered and they also resorted to firing at the Ahmadis resulting in death of three Ahmadis, namely Nazir Ahmad, Rafique and Mst. Nabila. On having learnt about this incident, police rushed to the spot. The SP/DSP and the Assistant Commissioner, Kharian were promptly informed by wireless and they also reached the village immediately. On their intervention, the hostility between the two communities subsided and fire set in the houses was extinguished. The property was saved from further damage. Respectables of both the groups were taken into confidence to start the investigation. Two cases, FIR No. 333 and 334, dated 16 July 1989 under sections 302/307/148/149/436 PPC, were registered by the Kharian police station. The majority of the accused from both the sect have been arrested to finalize the investigation on merit. An amount of PRs.2 lacs [200,000] has been sanctioned by the Provincial Government and placed at the disposal of Deputy Commissioner, Gujrat for disbursement to the legal heirs of the four deceased persons killed in the incident. The affected families of Ahmadis consisting of 362 members have since been rehabilitated in the village and they are living peacefully.\"",

Allegedly, religious leaders belonging to the Khatme Nabuwat faction and the local police had acquired Ahmadi literature in order to implicate the two men, who are said to have pleaded not guilty, but were reportedly found guilty under Penal Code provisions 298/B TP and 298/C. Each was sentenced to six years' imprisonment, including six months' solitary confinement, and to a fine of 30,000 rupees. It has also been reported that their imprisonment would be extended by an additional 18 months if they failed to pay the fines. It has been reported that there were no defence witnesses at the trial and that the prosecution witnesses made conflicting statements containing discrepancies and inconsistencies, a fact which was allegedly also admitted by the court. According to additional information received, Mr. Naseer Ahmad Alvi (aged 42) was shot by an unknown assailant in Duar District of Nawabshah, Sind province, on 16 November 1990, for being an adherent of the Ahmadi faith. It has been reported that Mr. Mohammad Sadiq Naseem, a bookbinder reported to be currently detained in the police prison in Chiniot, was arrested on 11 December 1990 in Rabwah and was charged with selling a proscribed work of Ahmadi literature, the Seerat Hazrat Masih Maudt to religious leaders who are opposed to the members of the Ahmadiyya community. It has further been reported that the police in Rabwah had arrested Mr. Shakoor Bhai Chashma Wala, an optician, at his shop on 3 December 1990 because he is an Ahmadi and charged him with keeping proscribed Ahmadi literature, such as Dafi-ul Balaa. in his shop. According to additional information received, the Police in Sarghoda, Punjab province, requested followers of the Ahmadi faith from 33 households to wipe off the Kalima Tayyaba inscription from the walls of their houses and the mosque at Chak No. 9, Panyar, within 24 hours. When the members of the Ahmadi community refused to do so, the police reportedly hired a person of the Christian faith to remove the inscriptions.\"",

Father Pico is said to have been a tireless defender of peoples' rights and a staunch advocate of social justice, expressing special concern for the poor members of his parish. It has been reported that a right-wing group enjoying strong military support was suspected of the killing. Father Pico is said to have been warned by friends that his life would be in danger unless he renounced his apostolic activity. Fr. Gregorio Patino, a Roman Catholic priest, is reported to have received several letters containing death threats, the most serious of which was dated 23 January 1991. It has been alleged that stones were thrown on a chapel of the Sisters of Rural Mission which is located near a military base. The conducting of an unauthorized search of a consumer cooperative, a project of the Basic Christian Community in Mandalagan, Bacolod City, which is administered by the Socio-pastoral Apostolate of the Order of St. Benedict Sisters, has also been reported.\"",

The death penalty is prescribed for apostasy. It has been reported that the death penalty is prescribed for apostasy and that during the holy month of Ramadan, the prohibition against public eating, drinking or smoking during daylight hours is enforced on non-Muslims as well as Muslims. Criticism of Islam is said not to be allowed and nothing embarrassing to the religious leadership can reportedly be published in the press. References to religions other than Islam on radio and television are allegedly removed. Non-Muslim religious activities and the importation of non-Islamic religious material such as Christmas cards and Christmas trees is reportedly also illegal. Foreigners are said to be allowed to practise their religion only in strict privacy and may face imprisonment and expulsion if they proselytize or attempt to arrange large religious gatherings. Persons wearing non-Islamic religious symbols in public may be arrested or publicly harassed by the members of the Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice (the Mutawwi'in). It has further been reported that any practice which is not in accordance with the Wahhabi interpretation of Islam is prohibited, as is the case with the use of the Shia call to prayer and other forms of public Shia practice which deviate from the practice of Sunni Islam. Public processions during the holy month of Muharram are prohibited while Shia public celebrations are restricted to specially designated areas within the principal Shia cities. It has been reported that the private construction of Shia mosques is seldom permitted. Members of the Shia Muslim community, estimated to number approximately 500,000, are allegedly subjected to officially sanctioned forms of economic and social discrimination as well as surveillance and restrictions on travel abroad. According to the sources, Saudi Shia Muslim citizens face discrimination in government and industrial employment, especially in jobs with national security implications and it has been reported that the national petroleum company which used to employ large numbers of Saudi Shia Muslims has been instructed to halt their employment and phase out the Shias from positions of responsibility. They are said to also face certain limitations with regard to access to social services. It has also been alleged that over 40 Shia activists are imprisoned in Riyadh on charges of radical Shiite activities. It has been reported that members of the Shia community can adjudicate only non-criminal intra-Shiite disputes within their own legal tradition.\"",

When he was summoned to register for military service for the first time, Mr. Maillard, citing his religious beliefs, submitted a request to the military authorities to do his service in a non-armed unit, a request which was granted. He did his four months' service at a training camp in 1985. The compulsory refresher course scheduled for 1986 was postponed. Mr. Maillard failed to appear for the inspection of weapons and equipment in 1987 and 1988. On 4 April 1988, Mr. Maillard wrote to the military authorities, informing them of his decision to refuse to serve for conscientious reasons and did not report for the refresher course beginning on 18 April 1988. On 28 August 1989 he explained to the military tribunal of Division 1 at Payerne that his decision arose from his profound religious beliefs, which involved condemnation of any use of violence, making further performance of his military obligations impossible. According to the sources, the military tribunal is said to have recognized that Mr. Maillard's refusal to serve was based on sincere religious belief and that he was involved in a serious conflict of conscience. Nevertheless, the court sentenced him to three months' imprisonment to be served as a criminal judgement, to the costs of the case, and to dismissal from the army.\"",

In a communication sent on 1 November 1991 addressed to the Government of Thailand, the following information was transmitted by the Special Rapporteur: According to the information received, the religious and lay residents of the Hooppha Sawan Religious Land, reportedly a centre for Buddhist and interreligious activities containing symbolic structures of all the major religions of the world, were threatened and forcibly evicted from this property and all their belongings were confiscated on 29 March 1991 on the orders of the Governor of Ratchaburi province and officials of the Religious Affairs Department. It has been reported that the headquarters of the International Federation of Religions is located at the Hooppha Sawan Religious Land and that both are under the patronage of the Jinnabuddho Memorial Foundation which had been granted permission in June 1973 by the Fine Arts Department to use the Tham Phra Archaeological Site in Рак Tho District, Ratchaburi province, to establish the Hooppha Sawan Meditation Centre on that location. It has been further reported that the Supreme Court had revoked the licence for the operation of the International Federation of Religions and the Jinnabuddho Memorial Foundation in July 1989 and ordered the cancellation of their registration and cessation of all their operations in December 1981, ruling that all their property become State property. Nevertheless, Dr. Suchart Kosolkitiwong, Chairman of the Jinnabuddho Memorial Foundation and President of the International Federation of Religions, and the Buddhist monks, novices, nuns and laymen were authorized by the Governor of Ratchaburi province and the District Officer of Рак Tho to remain on Hooppha Sawan Religious Land, look after the property and continué with their religious activities while the process of auditing the Foundation's property was taking place. On 20 March 1991, the authorities of Ratchaburi province ordered the closure of all Jinnabuddho Memorial Foundation property despite the fact that the Governor and the Рак Tho District Officer had not completed the process of auditing, stating that 'All persons living in the area of Hooppha Sawan must leave the location within three days from the date of this notification'. It has further been reported that on 28 March 1991 local policemen used firearms to intimidate and threaten the occupants and tore the robes of a number of monks, subsequently sealing off the area. Such action reportedly resulted in the death of one resident, Mr. Sahas Inthasiri, who had already been ill and who died of shock on 29 March 1991, when reinforced local police units came to evict the occupants. It has also been reported that the persons evicted from the Hooppha Sawan Religious Land who are currently practising religious activity at the Samnak Poo Sawan (the House of Divine Sages) in Bangkok have been threatened with eviction from this location as well. According to the information received, the Crime Suppression Division of the Ministry of the Interior has issued warrants for the arrest of 12 leading members of the Unification Church which is represented by the Unification Culture Foundation in Thailand. Warrants were reportedly also issued for the arrest of the Reverend and Mrs. Moon, should they come to the country, although they have not been accused of any violation of the law. It has been alleged that all Unification Church centres throughout the country have been raided and that documents, books and equipment have been seized indiscriminately. According to the sources, bail has repeatedly been denied for the persons who have already been imprisoned on the grounds that the movement they represent is a 'dangerous threat to the national security', although no formal charges have been brought against them.\"",

On 8 November 1991 the Special Rapporteur sent the following information to the Government of the United States of America under annex I: \"According to the information received, a decision rendered by the United States Supreme Court on 17 April 1990 in the case of Employment Division v. Smith would amount to a restriction of the right of indigenous people to practise their traditional religions. The case, as reported to the Special Rapporteur, has been summarized as follows: The Employment Division of Oregon's Department of Human Resources has denied unemployment compensation to two drug rehabilitation counsellors who are both members of the Native American Church because they had taken a hallucinogenic drug, peyote, which is proscribed by Oregon's controlled substance law, and were therefore considered as dismissed from their jobs for misconduct, despite the fact that this had taken place within the framework of a specific Native American religious ceremony. It has been reported that the peyote cactus has been traditionally used as a sacrament in the carefully circumscribed ritual context of American Indian religious ceremonies and it is said to be vital to the adherents' ability to practise their religion. It is further alleged that the Church's doctrine forbids nonreligious use of peyote and considers its use outside the ritual as sacrilegious. It has reportedly been admitted by scientists and other experts that peyote does not inflict permanent deleterious damage to the Indian and that the spiritual and social support provided by the Native American Church has been effective in combating the effects of alcoholism in the Native American population. In view of the fact that the active ingredient of peyote is a hallucinogenic substance, many States maintain exemptions for the religious use of peyote which give the indigenous people the 'right to use the plant for ceremonial purposes'. It has further been alleged that the Congress has recognized that certain substances, such as peyote, 'have religious significance because they are sacred, they have power, they heal, they are necessary to the exercise of the rites of religion, they are necessary to the cultural integrity of the tribe, and, therefore, religious survival'.\"",

Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Association previously mentioned in report E/CN.4/1989/44 which the Special Rapporteur submitted to the Commission on Human Rights at its forty-fifth session, additional clarifications ought to be made with regard to the case. At the time of the publication of the aforementioned report, it remained pending before a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the ninth circuit. According to the information received, the case at hand does not concern only a six-mile paved road on government land linking the California towns of Gasquet and Orleans but a 1981 proposal of the United States Forest Service to build 200 miles of logging roads through the Blue Creek Unit where the land is located and remove about 733 million board feet of timber from the area over the next 80 years. Blue Creek, a tributary of the Klamath River, is said to be surrounded by 30,000 hectares of land that make up the Blue Creek Unit, half of which is still reportedly covered with virgin Douglas fir forests. According to the sources, Indians Jimmie James, Sam Jones, Lowana Branter and Christopher Peters together with several environmental organizations took legal action to block this plan since they thought it would destroy the sacredness of the area and hinder the practice of traditional religious ceremonies. In April 1988, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the Indian sacred sites in Blue Creek Unit are not legally protected because the Unit as a whole is the property of the Government. It has been alleged that the Government can have no claim on this land in view of the fact that the Klamath and Hoopa Indian tribes never ceded it to the United States. The treaty concluded on 6 October 1851 was reportedly never ratified by the United States and the Government is said to never have performed its obligations pursuant to the treaty while the two tribes were still removed to small reservations. In addition, these tribes reportedly never agreed to relinquish their right to continue to use and enjoy sacred sites located on these lands. The north-eastern corner of the Blue Creek Unit is reportedly considered to be sacred land by the Yurok, Karok and Tolowa Indian tribes who use several mountain peaks, including Chimney Rock and Doctor Rock, as places of worship. The participants in the tribes' three most important annual ceremonies, such as the White Deerskin Dance, must pray on these mountain peaks in order to prepare for their religious duties. According to the sources, the Yurok, Karok and Tolowa Indian tribes did not participate in nor consent to the 1851 treaty and never gave up their right to use the land.\"",

The following information was transmitted under annex III: \"The Special Rapporteur was not able to establish beyond doubt whether Mr. LaRouche's association can be considered as falling under the terms of the Declaration on the Eliminaton of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. He nevertheless felt obliged to ask the Government of the United States of America to provide him with comments and observations thereon, since the allegations have been submitted to him with specific reference to the Declaration. According to the information received, United States citizen Mr. Lyndon H. LaRouche is reported to have been subjected to harassment, investigation and prosecution solely because of his beliefs. Mr. LaRouche, who is said to be the founder and leader of a metaphysical association whose beliefs are reportedly centered on the right of all peoples to development and economic justice, was indicted on 14 October 1988 and charged with 'conspiracy to commit fraud', 'mail fraud' and 'conspiracy to defraud the Internal Revenue Service'. On 27 January 1989 he was reportedly sentenced to five years' imprisonment on each charge, amounting to a sentence of 15 years in prison, by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria Division. Mr. LaRouche's trial is said to have been unfair and conducted in disregard for guarantees necessary for the defence. Exclusion of evidence has also been reported in this connection as well as the passing of an excessive sentence for crimes which are usually said to be regarded as minor civil or administrative infractions. On 22 January 1990 Mr. LaRouche's appeal of sentence was denied by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals which upheld the ruling of the District Court of Alexandria. It has been alleged that about 50 persons have so far been indicted because of their links with Mr. LaRouche's association and it has been reported that they, too, have had unfair trials. According to the sources, Mr. LaRouche's beliefs have reportedly also resulted in the seizure and closing down of five publishing companies whose publications had disseminated the ideas of his association.\"",

This means that in our country no distinction is made in any legislation or any administrative or judicial practice between religions and religious sects with regard to religious practice. In Burkina Faso all religions are free to carry on their activities and do not need any special authorization for the purpose. However, when members or leaders of a religious denomination decide to set up an association of a religious nature, they have to comply with the legislative provisions in force.\" \"Both the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and human rights legislation refer to religion in general, with no distinction made between religion, religious sects and religious associations. Furthermore, both the Charter and human rights legislation have been interpreted to apply to minority as well as to majority religions. Indeed, it has been emphasized by the Supreme Court of Canada that the primary purpose of section 2 (a) of the Charter, which guarantees freedom of religion, is to safeguard religious minorities from the threat of the 'tyranny of the majority (R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., (1985) 1 S.C.R. 295); and of section 15, which guarantees equality rights, to protect disadvantaged groups (Law Society of British Colombia v. Andrews, (1989) 1 S.C.R. 143). However, it should be noted that religious organizations are not rendered immune from the requirements of criminal or other relevant legislation by their religious status. For example, in Church of Scientology v. the Queen, (1987) 31 C.C.C. (3d) 449, the Ontario Court of Appeal held that the Church of Scientology was not protected from the operation of a search warrant relating to an alleged offence of fraud on its part by the guarantee of freedom of religion in the Charter.\" In its general reply, the Government of Cyprus referred to this question as follows: \"All religions whose doctrines or rites are not secret are free.

The use of physical or moral compulsion for the purpose of making a person change or preventing him from changing his religion is prohibited. Freedom to manifest one's religion or belief shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in the interests of the security of the Republic or the constitutional order or the public safety or the public order or the public health or the public morals or for the protection of the rights and liberties guaranteed by this Constitution to any person. Until a person attains the age of sixteen the decision as to the religion to be professed by him shall be taken by the person having the lawful guardianship of such person.\" \"The distinction between religion, religious sect and religious association: there is no legislative text giving a definition of religion and religious sect; however, on the basis of article 10 of the Fundamental Law, it can be said that a religious association is a group of citizens whose purpose is to engage collectively in religious activity. As far as religion is concerned, the official meaning of the term is that it is a set of doctrines and practices concerned with the relations between man and God. A religious sect, as distinguished from a religious association, is a group of individuals initiated into a certain religious practice and usuallybound to each other by a secret act of solidarity. It does not encourage the existence of religious sects, which are often a source of intolerance, fanaticism and practices prejudicial to the preservation of man's life and physical integrity.\" \"Haitian legislation makes no distinction between religions, religious sects and religious associations.

All sects enjoy freedom of worship. They are entitled to the holidays fixed by their culture. Thus Friday is a day of rest for Muslims, whereas Christians get Sunday and other holidays. Belonging to this or that religion does not prevent anyone from having access to public employment or from enlisting. In actual fact, Christians account for a considerable proportion of the government troops fighting in the south of the country. There are at present many Christians living in areas with a Muslim majority. Because of the war, Christians and other inhabitants of the south have emigrated by the thousands to the north, where they live among Muslims. They have even established themselves beyond Khartoum, along the border with Egypt, which completely refutes the allegation that the war in the south is a war of religion between Christians and Muslims.\" In its general reply to the questionnaire, the Government of Syria stated that \"the Syrian Constitution contains the following guarantees: ... Freedom of belief shall be safeguarded. The State shall respect all religions and shall guarantee freedom of all forms of religious observance. Every citizen has the right to express his opinion publicly and freely, either orally, in writing or through any other form of expression, and to participate in the task of monitoring and constructive criticism. Article 35, paragraph 2: The State shall guarantee freedom to engage in all religious observances in a manner consistent with public order.\" \"No distinction appears to be made. A religious organization must be registered by the Board of Inland Revenue in order to obtain charitable status.\" \"No distinction exists.\" \"National legislation and practice in the Ukrainian SSR make a distinction between the concepts of religion, religious organizations and religious communities, and this is reflected in the recently adopted Act of the Ukrainian SSR on freedom of conscience and religious organizations. The Act defines religion in the context of the broader concept of freedom of conscience. In accordance with article 3, every citizen of the Ukrainian SSR has the right to freedom of conscience. This right includes the freedom to have, adopt and change religion or belief at will and the freedom to profess any religion or none, and engage in religious worship individually or together with others. Religious organizations in the Ukrainian SSR are religious communities, authorities and centres, monasteries, religious fraternities, missionary societies, seminaries, and associations of religious organizations. Religious associations are represented by their own centres or authorities. Religious organizations in the Ukrainian SSR are set up in order to meet citizens' religious need for the profession and propagation of faith. They function according to their own hierarchical and institutional structure and elect, appoint and change their personnel according to their own constitutions or regulations. A religious community is a local religious association of believers of one religion, denomination, sect or doctrine, who are over 18 years of age and have willingly come together in order jointly to manifest their religion or belief, worship, and perform religious rites and ceremonies. The only legal criterion governing the activities of religious organizations and associations in the Ukrainian SSR is their conformity with the above-mentioned Act on freedom of conscience and religious organizations.\" In its reply, the Government of the United States of America did not specifically refer to this question, but it said the following: \"In the United States, freedom of religion is guaranteed by the first amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The first amendment states that 'congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of a religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ...' The first part of this provision has come to be Е/СЫ.4/1992/52 page 102 known as the 'establishment clause ; the second as the 'free exercise clause . In terms of protecting against religious intolerance, the free exercise clause is considerably more significant. The first amendment as a whole is applicable to the Governments of each of the States by virtue of the fourteenth amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Thus, no distinction is or properly can be made between religion, religious sects and religious associations. When a law or other governmental action is challenged as a violation of the establishment clause, U.S. courts will examine it under a three-part test. First, the law or other governmental action must have a secular purpose. Second, it must have a primarily secular effect. Third, it must not involve the Government in an excessive entanglement with religion.\" \"The answer is 'no . Our Constitution has a Declaration of Rights or Bill of Rights which is justifiable. One can appeal to the Supreme Court if any of these rights are violated. Section 19 (one of those fundamental rights) of our Constitution provides for the protection of the Freedom of Conscience.\"",

If not, in what way is the treatment different? \"Section 116 of the Australian Constitution has the effect of affording protection to believers of all faiths. In this context it should be noted that the High Court of Australia has given a broad interpretation to the concept of religion (Church of the New Faith v. Commissioner for Payroll Tax (1983) 49 ALR 65). This broad interpretation would not cover a lack of any religious belief (i.e. atheists) but it should be noted that there are no Australian laws or practices which draw adverse distinctions between believers and non-believers. On the contrary, there are specific efforts made to accommodate both believers and non-believers, such as the provision in public life or the courts for taking either a religious oath or for non-believers, an affirmation (e.g. in relation to the provision of evidence in court).\" \"In this country all persons enjoy equal protection and guarantees without any distinction. Article б of the Political Constitution of the State expressly states: 'Every human being has legal personality and capacity, in accordance with the laws. He enjoys the rights, freedoms and guarantees recognized by this Constitution, without distinction as to race, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, origin, economic or social condition, or any other. The dignity and freedom of the person are inviolable. To respect them and protect them is a primary duty of the State'.\" \"There is equal protection to all believers and non-believers.\" In its reply, the Government indicated that \"Any citizen is free to practise the religion of his choice or not to practise it, in accordance with article 7 of the Constitution, which guarantees 'freedom of belief, non-belief and religious opinion'. Similarly, no distinction is made between citizens and aliens in matters of religion.\" \"The Supreme Court of Canada has stated that at the very least freedom of religion in the Charter should mean that government may not coerce individuals to affirm a specific religious belief or manifest a specific religious practice (R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., (1985) 1 S.C.R. 295). Thus free thinkers, agnostics and atheists would be protected by the Charter from any coercion in this regard. Furthermore, section 2(a) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees freedom of religion and conscience. For the most part Charter cases based on section 2(a) have involved claims relating to religion in stricto sensu rather than more generally to matters of conscience. However, in R. v. Morgentaler et al., (1988) I S.C.R. 30 [it was] indicated in a concurring judgement that section 2(a) should be interpreted broadly to extend to conscientiously held beliefs, whether grounded in religion or in a secular morality.\" In its reply, the Government of Cyprus did not refer specifically to this question, but stated the following: \"According to the Constitution of Cyprus, which is the supreme law in the Republic, all religions are free and equal before the law. Freedom of religion and conscience also includes convictions such as agnosticism, free thinking, pacifism, atheism and rationalism. Article 18 of the Constitution provides that 'every person has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. Moreover, Article 28 provides that: - 1. All persons are equal before the law, the administration and justice and are entitled to equal protection thereof and treatment thereby. - 2. Every person shall enjoy all the rights and liberties provided for in this Constitution without any direct or indirect discrimination against any person on the ground of his community, race, religion, language, sex, political or other convictions, national or social descent, birth, colour, wealth, social class, or on any ground whatsoever, unless there is express provision to the contrary in this Constitution. - 3. No citizen shall be entitled to use or enjoy any privilege of any title of nobility or of social distinction within the territorial limits of the Republic. - 4. No title or nobility or other social distinction shall be conferred by or recognised in the Republic. Additional guarantees are provided under the following legal instruments which Cyprus has ratified and have superior force to any domestic law except the Constitution: (a) The European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ratified by Law 39/62);; (b) The International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination (ratified by Law 12/67);; (c) The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ratified by Law 14/69);; (d) The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ratified by Law 14/69).\"; \"Belief in God has been firmly rooted in the hearts of our people for thousands of years and the provision of the Constitution and the law apply to all Egyptians without distinction,\" \"Believers of all religious denominations enjoy the same protection. This explains why all religions have the same air time to propagate their doctrines and call their congregations together.\" \"The Constitution of the Republic, in article 30, guarantees the protection of religious denominations and non-believers, provided they do not violate law and order or disturb the peace.\" \"These groups are afforded equal protection.\" \"According to the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Government is duty-bound to treat non-Muslims including non-believers and free thinkers etc. in conformity with ethical norms and principles of Islamic Justice and equity, and to respect their human rights. This principle applies to all who refrain from engaging in conspiracy or activity against Islam and the Islamic Republic of Iran.

The mainstream of political Zionism which led to the establishment of the State of Israel and continues to guide the direction of the country today, is based upon the idea of a democratic Jewish State. National and historical religious elements intermingle which give Israel its uniquely Jewish character. Nevertheless there is no State religion in Israel. Intrinsic to the democratic way of life, neither in law nor in practice are restrictions placed upon any individual's right to freedom of belief, regardless of which faith he belongs to or if he belongs to no faith at all. On the contrary, the State of Israel is committed to the equal protection under the law of believers of all faiths and non-believers alike.",

The Basic Law: Jerusalem, capital of Israel (L.S.I, vol. 34, p. 209) reiterates and emphasizes the rights of free access of members of the different religions to the holy places and the prohibition against their desecration.\" \"Believers of all denominations and non-believers enjoy the same protection.\" \"According to article 35 of the political constitution, the same protection is given to believers of any religious denomination and to non-believers (free thinkers, agnostics, atheists).\" (b) and (d) \"The inviolability of freedom of conscience, religion and worship is guaranteed by the Portuguese Constitution (article 41, No. 1).; This guarantee cannot be suspended even in a state of siege. Reaffirming the provisions of earlier constitutions, and also of Act 4/71 mentioned above, article 41, No. 2, of the Constitution states that no one can be prosecuted, deprived of rights or exempted from obligations or civic duties because of his religious beliefs or practices. The rights set forth in that article derive from the constitutional principle of the equality of citizens before the law (art. 13). Although non-denominational, the Portuguese State nevertheless accords special status to the Catholic religion. This special status is primarily due to the historical importance of that religion. Until the establishment of the Republic in 1910, Portugal was a State which accepted the Catholic religion as its official religion. The separation law of 1911, which recognized the principle of the freedom of conscience and religion, forbade religious education in schools, even private ones, and placed religious associations under the protection of the State. The difficult situation in which the Catholic Church was placed in relation to the State by this legislation, was not resolved until the agreement was concluded with the Holy See. The special status enjoyed by the Catholic Church does not, however, interfere with the principle of religious freedom recognized by the State with regard to all other religions. An example of the application of the principle of equality is the social security system, which covers the clergy of the Catholic Church and ministers of other churches, and religious associations and denominations (regulatory decree 5/83 of 31 January). It may also be mentioned that recent changes have been introduced as regards tax exemptions, which cover all denominations and not just the Catholic Church.\" \"Believers of all faiths and non-believers enjoy the same legal protection. As an illustration one need only refer to article 16 of the Constitution, which states that 'All citizens are equal before the law, without any discrimination, in particular on grounds of race, colour, origin, ethnic group, clan, sex, opinion, religion or social position'. Rwandese criminal law punishes aversion, hatred and discrimination based on a person's belonging or not belonging to a particular religion.\" In its reply, the Government of Syria stated the following: \"Article 35, paragraph 1: freedom of belief shall be safeguarded and the State shall respect all religions.\" \"The State gives the necessary protection to its citizens on an equal basis whether they are believers or not.\" \"Yes. Under the Constitution of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago every individual has the fundamental right to freedom of thought and expression as well as freedom of conscience, association and assembly. Under the Education Act no child can be compelled, against the wishes of his parent, to attend religious instruction in a public school.\" \"No different treatment takes place. Equal protection is accorded in the full sense regardless of belief, religion or conscience.\" \"The legislation of the Ukrainian SSR guarantees equal protection under the law to adherents of every religion and to non-believers. The law stipulates that every citizen has the right to express openly and propagate freely his or her own religion or his or her atheistic belief. Nobody can be coerced into professing or refusing to profess a religion, to participate or not participate in public worship, religious rites and ceremonies or into studying religion. Freedom to manifest one's religion or belief in the Ukrainian SSR is subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals or the rights and freedoms of other citizens.\" In its reply, the Government of the United States of America did not refer specifically to this question, but stated the following: \"The free exercise clause provides protection for the practice of any religion. It requires that the Government not prohibit any religious belief nor confer any benefit or impose any burden on individuals because of their religious beliefs. Additionally, the clause requires that the Government make some accommodation for the practice of religious beliefs. However, this accommodation must not be of such a nature as to favour religion over non-religion. One case recently decided by the U.S. Supreme Court demonstrates the practical limits of the free exercise clause. In employment division, department of human resources of Oregon v. Ball, 110 S.C.T. 1595 (1990), the Court held that the State of Oregon could, consistent with the free exercise clause, deny claimants unemployment compensation benefits on the ground of misconduct where the claimants were dismissed from their drug counselling positions due to their use of the drug peyote, illegal under Oregon Criminal Law, at a ceremony of the native American church. The Court reaffirmed that the free exercise clause includes the right to believe and profess whatever religious doctrine one desires. However, the Court ruled that the right of free exercise of religion does not relieve an individual of an obligation to comply with a valid or neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes conduct that is contrary to a religious practice. In deciding this case, the Court also stated that the Government would violate the free exercise clause if it sought to ban religious acts only when they were engaged for religious reasons or only because of the religious belief displayed. The Court also ruled that States could make non-discriminatory religious practice exemptions to drug laws, but that such exemptions were not constitutionally required. The establishment clause of the first amendment essentially ensures the so-called 'separation of Church and State' in the United States. As interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court, it requires that Government neither aid nor formally establish a religion. The clause also prohibits the Government from promoting a preference for religion over non-religion.\" \"The answer is 'yes.'\" \"The rights of citizens to practise their faith (whether such citizens constitute a religious minority or majority) is protected by section 116 of the Constitution, ... above, and by the criminal law of the States and Territories.\" \"As already stated, all persons enjoy equal rights. Accordingly, all inhabitants are entitled to practise their religion freely. Article 3 of the Political Constitution of the State says in this connection: 'The State recognizes and supports the Roman Catholic apostolic religion, and guarantees the public practice of any other faith. Relations with the Catholic Church shall be governed by concordats between the Bolivian State and the Holy See.\" \"Freedom of worship (conscience) is guaranteed and protected by the Constitution to each individual alone or in community with others.\" \"As indicated above, section 15 of the [Canadian] Charter [of Rights and Freedoms] protects religious minorities from discrimination on the basis of religion and section 2(a) guarantees them freedom of religion. A number of Charter cases have resulted in legal provisions which favoured the majority religion being declared invalid. For example, in R. v. Big M Drug Mart the federal Lord Day's Act, which required all persons to observe Sunday, the Christian day of religious observance, as a day of rest was struck down. And in Zylberberg v. Sudbury Board of Education, (1988) 52 D.L.R. (4th) 577 the Ontario Court of Appeal held that a requirement that Ontario public schools conduct religious exercises at the beginning of the day was unconstitutional, where the exercises were Christian in nature rather than ecumenical. However it should also be noted that in some circumstances limitations on religious minorities are held to be valid, where they are reasonable limits that are demonstrably justifiable in a free and democratic society within the terms of section 1 of the Charter. For example, the courts have indicated that it is not inconsistent with the guarantee of freedom of religion in the Charter for blood transfusions to be administered in emergency circumstances to the children of Jehovah's Witnesses against their parents' wishes. On the other hand, in Malette v. Shulman (30 March 1990) the Ontario Court of Appeal held that a doctor who administered blood transfusions to a competent adult Jehovah's Witness against her wishes, as stated in a card found on her person when she was unconscious after an accident, was liable for assault and battery. Similarly, the protection against discrimination on the basis of religion found in human rights legislation has been of considerable practical assistance to members of religious minorities. For example, in Ontario Human Rights Commission and O'Malley v. Simpsons Sears Ltd. et al.. (1985) 2 S.C.R. 536 the Supreme Court of Canada held that an employer contravened the Ontario Human Rights Code when it failed to make reasonable accommodation to the request of an employee not to work on Saturday because it was her day of religious observance.\" In its reply, the Government of Cyprus did not specifically refer to this question, but it said the following: \"No person shall be compelled to pay any tax or duty the proceeds of which are specially allocated in whole or in part for the purposes of a religion other than his own.\" \"The concept of racial or religious minorities is unknown to the Egyptian people, since the Constitution and the legislation that has been promulgated guarantee freedom of belief and religious observance for all Egyptians.\" \"The prohibition by law of any form of discrimination and the penalties laid down for this purpose constitute a guarantee of the right of minorities, whether religious, ethnic, political or other.\" \"All Haitian citizens enjoy the same protection in the practice of their faith, even if they belong to a religious minority.\" \"All citizens enjoy the same legal right to practise their faith regardless of what kind of a religion or belief it is, as long as it does not go against ordre public.\" \"The minorities are protected by the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran in accordance with principles of the constitution and the law related to the affairs of personal status of non-Shi'a Iranians adopted in 1953.\" \"These rights are protected by the Constitution of Ireland (Arts. 40 and 44).\" \"1. The State of Israel is committed to the protection of the right of all citizens to practise their faith, regardless of whether or not they constitute a religious minority.

Every year, despite the security risks involved, thousands of Israel's Muslim citizens travel from Israel through neighbouring Arab countries to Saudi Arabia in order to observe the Haj. This policy was reinforced by the Supreme Court which recognized the right of freedom of movement and the State's obligation to enable its Muslim citizens to practise their religion, even if this meant permitting travel to a country at war with Israel.

Finally, chapter XIII of the Criminal Code of 1991, which is concerned with punishing crimes connected with religion, makes it an offence, among other things, to offend religious beliefs, to profane places of worship, to disturb religious ceremonies and to interfere with the dead or with graves.\" \"Under the Constitution ... every individual has the fundamental right to freedom of religious belief and observance. Parents or guardians of children have the fundamental right to provide a school of their choice for the education of their children or wards.

It is an offence to disturb any place of worship or to molest any person or minister therein.\" \"Equal rights are secured under the Constitution.

However, articles 4 and 5 of the Act on freedom of conscience and religious organizations establishes the principle of the equality of all citizens and religions before the law. Article 5 states: 'All religions, religious sects, movements and doctrines are equal before the law. The Ukrainian SSR through its higher and local organs of State authority and administration shall encourage the establishment of mutual religious and ideological tolerance and respect among believers and non-believers, and between the believers of different religions and their religious organizations'.\" In its reply, the Government of the United States of America stated that: \"In maintaining the separation of Church and State, the establishment clause indirectly protects against religious intolerance by ensuring that the Government cannot use its authority to coerce or even influence individuals into practising one religion over another. This principle is so well established in the United States that recent cases arising under the establishment clause deal with peripheral ways in which governmental action indirectly affects religious practice. For example, the United States Supreme Court recently struck down a statute enacted by the legislature of the State of Alabama authorizing a one-minute period of silence in all public schools 'for meditation or voluntary prayer (Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 United States 38 (1985)). The Court found that the purpose of the statute was to endorse religion and that it did not have any clear secular purpose. The United States Supreme Court also recently invalidated a school district programme in the State of Michigan in which teachers from religious schools taught classes at public expense in religious school buildings (School District of City of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U.S. 373 (1985)). The Court found that such a programme had the 'primary or principal effect of advancing religion. Lastly, the Supreme Court held a State of Louisiana statute that required instruction in the theory of 'creation science' whenever the theory of evolution was taught violative of the establishment clause (Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578 (1987)). The Court found that the act impermissibly endorsed religion by advancing the religious belief that a supranatural being created mankind. As the Court explained, the establishment clause not only prevents the Government from endorsing a religion or religion over non-religion, it also encourages religious tolerance by persons in the United States because it does not allow a particular religion or religion itself to enjoy a superior status.\" \"The rights, of both citizens, residents and non-residents, to practise their faith is provided for and guaranteed by our justiciable Bill of Rights.\" 85. (d) Does your country apply the principle of reciprocity as regards the practice of religion by foreigners? \"The practice of religion by foreigners in Australia is not restricted in any way.

Objection on the ground of conscientious belief is recognised whether or not the ground of the belief is of a religious character and whether or not the belief is part of the doctrines of a religion.

Under the terms of article 49 of the above-mentioned Act, this offence is punishable by a penalty of not less that two years' imprisonment and/or a fine of LE 2,000-5,000.; (b) Under the terms of article 50 of the above-mentioned Act, any person who, having an obligation to perform military service, evades it, or attempts to evade it, in a fraudulent manner or by submitting invalid documents in such a way as to obtain exemption, dispensation or the postponement or avoidance of such service in an unlawful manner is liable to a penalty of three to seven years' imprisonment.; (c) Under the terms of article 51 of the above-mentioned Act, any person who inflicts upon himself, or causes others to inflict upon him, a wound, injury or infirmity that renders him permanently medically unfit for military service is liable to a penalty of up to seven years' imprisonment.; (d) Under the terms of article 52 of the above-mentioned Act, any person who, without a valid excuse, fails to respond to a call-up for service in the reserve is liable to a penalty of not less than one year's imprisonment and/or a fine of not less than LE 200.; From the above, it is evident that Egyptian law prescribes penalties for offences relating to compulsory military service, regardless of whether the motives of the offenders are attributable to religious reasons and regardless of their religious faith or belief, in accordance with the legal principle embodied in article 40 of the Constitution, to which reference has already been made.\" \"Guiñean law does not provide for compulsory military service and there is therefore no legal or regulatory provision on conscientious objection.

The Law provides that the Minister of Defense has the discretion to order exemptions from military service for reasons connected with the requirements of education, reasons of State economy, extenuating family circumstances and for other reasons. 2. In a recent case the High Court of Justice held that 'other reasons' (for granting a military exemption) are not necessarily connected to reasons of security, but that such exemptions are also based on non-military grounds, which among others, include grounds of religion (H.C.J. 910/86 42 PD (II) 441) Accordingly, postponement of military service is granted under the law for so long as the applicant is able to prove that his sole occupation is exclusively religious studies. 3. Section 39(g) of the Defense Service Law provides that in the event that a woman can prove under procedures stated in regulations of the said law that for reasons of conscience or religious family lifestyle she is prevented from serving in the military she shall receive an exemption from military service. 4. In times of military necessity it must be stressed that the IDF's needs are given high priority. Thus at present complete exemption for men on grounds of conscience is not given. This is particularly understandable in Israel's case given the vast regular armies of some neighbouring countries which openly assert that they are at war with Israel. Israel, in contrast with her neighbours, relies primarily on civilian reservists, both men and women who are mobilized in times of necessity. Therefore, Israel's vital need to mobilize its limited population to serve as a reserve force.\" The Italian Government did not reply specifically to the questionnaire but referred to a document concerning conscientious objection, which says among other things: \"In Italy conscientious objectors are covered by the Act of 15 December 1972, No. 772, and by the Decree of the President of the Republic of 28 November 1977, No. 1139, containing rules on the application of the Act itself. On the basis of these provisions, any citizen liable to military service who declares that for compelling reasons of conscience he is opposed in all circumstances to the personal use of weapons is entitled to submit a special request to be allowed to do civilian service instead of military service. The status of conscientious objector is recognized by a decree of the Ministry of Defence after a compulsory previous opinion by a special board, in accordance with article 4 of Act 772/72, appointed by the Minister himself. The duration of civilian service is fixed at 12 months, following decision No. 470/89 of the Constitutional Court, declaring that article 5, paragraph 1, of Act 772/72 was unconstitutional in providing for a period of civilian service eight months longer than the duration of military service. Civilian service is performed with bodies, organizations and institutions approved by the administration of the Ministry of Defence in the areas of assistance, education, civil protection, and safeguard and development of the national forests. Conscientious objectors are treated in the same way for all purposes as those doing military service, except in any matters relating to disciplinary and penal questions. In decision No. 113/86, the Constitutional Court did in fact decide that article 11 of Act 772/72 was unconstitutional in making conscientious objectors subject to the jurisdiction of military courts. Once they are recognized as conscientious objectors, young conscripts lose their status as members of the armed forces and any offences committed in the course of civilian service are dealt with by the ordinary criminal courts.\" \"Luxembourg has no compulsory military service.\" \"In the Republic of Panama there is no compulsory military service, only Panamanians are required to comply with article 306 of the Political Constitution, which reads: 'Art. 306: All Panamanians are obliged to take up arms to defend the national independence and territorial integrity of the State, except as provided in article 16 of this Constitution. The law will regulate the application of this provision and the conditions governing exemption from compliance with it.\" \"Under article 41, No. 6, of the Constitution, the right to conscientious objection is guaranteed by law. The National Defence Act (Act 29/82 of 11 December) regards as objectors citizens who for religious, moral or philosophical reasons cannot legitimately, in accordance with their beliefs, use violent means of whatever nature against other people, even for reasons of national, collective or personal defence, and who have been recognized as objectors under the laws defining the status of conscientious objector. Act 6/85 of 4 May defines the status of conscientious objector. Under this act, conscientious objectors enjoy all the rights and have the same duties as are provided by the Constitution and the law for all citizens in general which are not incompatible with the status of conscientious objector (art. 10). The right to conscientious objection includes exemption from military service, whether in peacetime or in wartime. Nevertheless, objectors have to perform a civilian service [under conditions] at least as onerous as those of armed military service. In determining tasks and assigning duties to be performed in civilian service the preferences expressed by the person concerned have to be taken into account (art. 27).\" \"Our country has no law establishing compulsory military service.

According to article 4, paragraph 3, of the Act on freedom of conscience and religious organizations, 'Nobody may use his religious convictions as a reason for refusing to fulfil his legal obligations'.\" In its reply, the Government of the United States of America did not specifically answer this question. However, in its general reply, it referred thereto as follows: \"In addition to these constitutional protections, certain U.S. statutes guard against religious intolerance. The United States provides a statutory exemption from combatant military training and service (50 U.S.C.A. APP. SEC. 456). The exemption applies to those who by reason of religious training and belief are conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form. Under the statute, the term \"religious training and belief\" does not include essentially political, sociological or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code. However, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that the statutory exemption from military service applies to all persons who are opposed to war in any form on the basis of beliefs which are the functional equivalent of a theistic religious belief.\" \"We have not experienced such problems in this country.\" \"(f) and (g) Clashes between members of different religious denominations in Australia are relatively rare. If such clashes should occur it is the responsibility of the police force to deal with them as with any incident of violence. The Commonwealth and State Governments have cooperative arrangements in place to investigate and deal with incidents of violence directed against religious or ethnic groups. Where appropriate these arrangements include consultation with the leaders of communities that may be the victims of violence. The National Inquiry into Racist Violence conducted by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission during 1989-1991 did bring to light the prevalence of incidents of racial/religious violence, where people practising certain religions have been the victims of discrimination or violence on the basis of an imputed link with a particular ethnic background. Thus, Muslim people were the subject of increased harassment at the time of the Gulf crisis. Incidents of violence were reported to the Inquiry particularly by the Jewish community and Muslim Australians. In view of this link between religious and racial harassment the Inquiry recommended that the Racial Discriminaton Act 1975 be amended to specifically provide: 'that discrimination against or harassment of a person on account of that person's religious belief be prohibited where the religious belief is commonly associated with persons of a particular race or races or of a particular ethnic group or groups and is used as a surrogate for discrimination or harassment on the basis of race or ethnicity.' (recommendation 10, p. 390) The Inquiry also recommended the creation of offences for the act of inciting racial hostility and racist violence. The changes recommended by the Inquiry are under consideration by the Government.\" \"There are no clashes of violence in Belize that are noticeable between members of different religious denominations. Verbal clashes do occur, however, these are within permissible boundaries of our Criminal and Civil Laws.

Some of these articles correspond to provisions already contained in a decree which goes back to the time of the establishment of the Republic. That is the case with the crimes of religious constraint (art. 221), hindrance or disturbance of an act of worship (art. 222) and insult or offence to a minister of religion (art. 224). However, two other situations, which relate to the respect due to religious beliefs and faiths are covered in the new Criminal Code. They are outrages against religious beliefs and functions and against religious worship. Under article 220 of the Criminal Code, anybody who publicly outrages and ridicules another in a rude and gross manner because of his religious beliefs or functions is liable to a penalty of imprisonment for up to one year and a fine of up to 100 days. Anyone who profanes a place or object of worship or religious veneration is subject to the same penalty.

The most serious of them is interdenominational conflict, which has involved the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church, the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church and the Russian Orthodox Church. Ideologically speaking, religion was long treated as 'the opium of the people' and all dogmas were subject to savage propaganda attacks. Under such conditions, despite legislation on religion, there were inevitably practical infringements and restrictions on the rights of believers of all faiths. In 1928 the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, active in the eastern Ukraine, was banned. In 1946 the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church was banned. Many priests of both churches were repressed and believers were deprived of places of worship and persecuted. At the end of 1989, the Council on Religious Affairs of the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR stated that Greek-Catholic believers would henceforth 'enjoy all the rights guaranteed by law to religious communities in the Ukrainian SSR'. In July 1990, the First All-Ukrainian Synod of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church was held in Kiev and elected a patriarch. Unfortunately, the revival of the two ancient branches of the Ukrainian Church has led to very serious interdenominational conflict, which hinges on the fight for church property and spheres of influence. The Government of the Ukrainian SSR, while not interfering in interdenominational relations, is striving to ensure that believers of all faiths have equal opportunities to enjoy their religious rights and, hence, to bring about an end to religious hostility. We are making every effort to create the necessary conditions for the normalization of inter-church relations in order to achieve a peaceful and just resolution of the religious problems which have been building up for decades. In the context of the democratic process of renewal currently taking place in the Ukrainian SSR, the Government of the Republic recently adopted a series of measures designed to build a peaceful dialogue between the various faiths, to improve relations between Church and State and, ultimately, to ensure practical religious freedom. In turn this should facilitate a fuller and more extensive implementation of the provisions of the 1981 United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief in the Ukrainian SSR. At present there are registered in the Ukrainian SSR around 10,000 different religious associations, belonging to the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church, the Russian Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic, the Old Belief, Seventh-Day Adventist and Evangelical churches, and also Jewish, Muslim, Methodist and other religious associations. Over the past few years the number of religious associations in the Ukrainian SSR has almost doubled. In recent times alone a Russian Orthodox Seminary (in Kiev), a Ukrainian Orthodox Seminary (in Lvov) and several monasteries have opened in the Ukrainian SSR and a Seventh-Day Adventist Church centre has been set up. Religious associations regularly receive Bibles and other religious literature, some of it from abroad, and undertake their own publishing, producing magazines, newspapers, church calendars, and special collections. So, for instance, in 1990 approximately 250,000 copies of the Bible in Ukrainian entered the Republic from abroad. Between 1988 and the present time over 600,000 copies have been received. The Republic's religious organizations are developing international links. In 1989-1990 several thousand religious activists from many countries visited the Ukrainian SSR.\" In its reply, the Government of the United States of America indicated that \"although clashes between different religious denominations and crimes based on religious prejudice are infrequent in the United States, the United States has taken further efforts to reduce such incidents.\" \"No. We have not experienced any yet.\" Australia See under (f). \"It has not been necessary to take any such steps because no incidents of the kind mentioned have occurred.\" \"We have not had any expressions of extremist or fanatical opinions which may lead to religious intransigence or intolerance.\" In its reply, the Government did not refer specifically to this question, but it stated the following: \"with regard to fundamentalism and religious intolerance, Burkina Faso welcomes the fact that these extremist forms of expression have not found favour in its territory.\" \"In Canada there are a number of restrictions on the expression of opinions which might lead to religious intransigence or intolerance. Section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act prohibits communication by telephone of any matter that is likely to expose persons to hatred or contempt on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination. In Taylor et al. v. Canadian Human Rights Commission, (1987) 3 F.C. 593 the Federal Court of Appeal held that this provision did not violate section 2(b) of the [Canadian] Charter [of Rights and Freedoms], which guarantees freedom of expression. Section 319 of the Criminal Code prohibits the wilful promotion of hatred against an identifiable group. In R. v. Keecrstra (13 December, 1990) the Supreme Court of Canada held that this type of communication came within the scope of freedom of expression in section 2(b) of the Charter, but that the restriction upon it was a reasonable limit within the terms of section 1 of the Charter. Therefore the provision was constitutionally valid. Furthermore, the Radio Regulations, 1986 and the Television Broadcasting Regulations, 1987 prohibit the broadcast of any abusive comment or pictorial representation that tends to expose an individual or group on the basis of a number of characteristics including religion.\" \"There has been no need for taking any such steps.\" \"The Egyptian Constitution guarantees freedom of opinion, expression and publication within the limits of the law and any steps that are taken to prevent the expression of extremist opinion are regulated by the provisions of the law and the Constitution when expression of opinion exceeds the limits and becomes denigratory or contemptuous of religion or belief. It should be noted that, under article 98 (f) of the Egyptian Penal Code, the exploitation of religion to promote or advocate extremist ideologies, whether orally, in writing or by any other means, with a view to stirring up civil strife, disparaging a divinely-revealed religion or its adherents or prejudicing national unity or social harmony, is regarded as a criminal offence.\" The Government of Egypt subsequently provided the following additional information concerning this question: The Egyptian Penal Code protects the principle of freedom of belief and religious observance, as set forth in the Egyptian Constitution, by designating as a criminal offence all acts which prejudice or infringe that principle. Acts which are designated as criminal offences under the terms of article 98 (f) of the Penal Code (an article which was inserted therein pursuant to Act No. 29 of 1982): A penalty of imprisonment for a period of not less than six months and not more than five years, or a fine of not less that LE 500 and not more than LE 1,000, shall be imposed on any person who exploits religion in order to promote or advocate extremist ideologies by word of mouth, in writing or in any other manner with a view to stirring up sedition, disparaging or belittling any divinely-revealed religion or its adherents, or prejudicing national unity or social harmony. Acts which are designated as criminal offences under the terms of article 160 of the Penal Code (as amended by Act No. 29 of 1992): A penalty of imprisonment and/or a fine of not less that LE 100 and not more than LE 500 shall be imposed on: (i) any person who destroys, damages or desecrates premises intended for the celebration of religious rites, emblems or other article venerated by the members of a religious community or group of people; (ii) any person who uses violence or threats to disrupt or interrupt the religious observances or celebrations of any community; and (iii) any person who profanes or desecrates graves or cemeteries. Acts which are designated as criminal offences under the terms of article 161 of the Penal Code: The penalties prescribed in the preceeding article also apply to: (a) The printing or publiction of scriptures that are revered by members of a religious community, whose rights are performed in public, in such a way as to deliberately distort and alter the meaning of the text of those scriptures.; (b) The mimicry of a religious celebration in a public place or gathering with the aim of ridiculing it or exposing it to public view.; The provisions of the Egyptian Constitution in this connection are based on the principles of freedom of religion and belief, non-discrimination among citizens in this regard, and the guarantee by the State of freedom of religious observance. Accordingly, the position adopted by the Egyptian Constitution is in keeping with the practice of the international community, as defined in the international covenants and conventions concerning human rights and freedoms. Moreover, the role of the Egyptian legislature in the formulation of these principles was not confined to the promulgation of constitutional provisions since, as already indicated, those principles have been granted legal protection through the designation as criminal offences of all acts which prejudice or infringe them and through the prescription of penalties to deter the perpetrators of such acts. The above provisions clearly show the extent of the respect and freedom which religions enjoy in Egypt and which is guaranteed by the Constitution and protected by law.\" Guinea \"Yes! As already stated, Guiñean law does not tolerate the expression of extremist opinions. In article 20, paragraph 3, the Fundamental Law states that 'every citizen has a duty to respect other people and their opinions'.\" \"As stated under item 6, the exercise of religious faiths must not violate law and order or disturb the peace. The State reserves the right to intervene if they are endangered.\" \"No, as there has been no motivation to take such steps.\" \"Within Iran there is no conflict among followers of different branches of Islam and other recognized religions.\" \"Protection against 'the expression of extremist or fanatical opinions' is afforded under Irish law.\" \"1. The State of Israel recognizes that the expression in words or actions of extremist or fanatical opinions may lead to religious discrimination which may threaten the democratic principles upon which the State was established. Therefore the State of Israel has taken legal and judicial measures to limit the expression of extremism which may lead to religious intolerance. In limiting the expression of such views the Israeli courts have been careful to give the appropriate consideration to freedom of expression.",

(h) & (i) \"The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986 empowers the Commission to inquire into any act or practice that may constitute discrimination and, where it is considered appropriate, to effect a conciliated settlement of the matters that gave rise to the inquiry. Discrimination is defined as including any distinction, exclusion or preference made on the basis of religion, that has the effect of nullifying or impairing equality of opportunity or treatment in employment or occupation. However, it does not include a distinction, exclusion or preference and in respect of a particlar job based on the inherent requirements of the job. Nor does it include a distinction, exclusion or preference -; > in connection with employment as a member of the staff of an institution that is conducted in accordance with the doctrines, tenets, beliefs or teachings of a particular religion or creed, being a distinction, exclusion or preference made in good faith in order to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents of that religion or creed (HREOC Act section 3, definition of discrimination)• Under the Act, the Commission can also endeavour to resolve complaints of breaches of human rights by Commonwealth government authorities by conciliation. For the purposes of the Act, human rights means the rights and freedoms recognized in or declared by the International Covenant on Civil and Politicial Rights, the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, the Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons and the Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons. Consequently, with respect to religion, the Commission can endeavour to resolve complaints that a Commonwealth authority has breached: . the ICCPR, including - Article 2 - recognition of the rights in the Covenant without distinction, such as religion; Article 18 - freedom of thought, conscience and religion ... ; Article 20.2 - prohibition of advocacy of religious hatred ... ; Article 24 - children's rights to measures of protection without discrimination as to religion; Article 27 - rights of religious minorities to practise their own religion; . the following principles of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child - Principle 1 - Enjoyment of rights in the Declaration without distinction or discrimination on account of religion; Principle 10 - Protection of children from practices which may foster religious discrimination; . Article 1 of the Declaration of the Rights of Disabled Persons enjoyment of rights in the Declaration without distinction or discrimination on the ground of religion.

The courts have indicated that this provision gives them a wide discretion to frame an appropriate remedy in the circumstances. Section 52 of the Constitution Act 1982 provides that a law which is inconsistent with the Constitution of Canada, which includes the Charter, is of no force and effect. Human rights legislation provides a wide spectrum of remedies for persons whose rights under such legislation have been infringed. For example, under the Canadian Human Rights Act a Human Rights Tribunal may inter alia order the person found to have committed a discriminatory practice to cease such practice, to adopt an affirmative action programme, to make available to the person discriminated against those rights that were denied him or her, and/or to compensate the victim for the loss of wages or expenses incurred as a result of the discrimination.\" \"Any person complaining to be a victim of such discrimination by a public authority may, as a first step, ask to remedy the situation through a petition to such authority (administrative recourse).

Article 146 of the Constitution provides an effective judicial remedy against 'any decision, act or omission of any organ, authority or person which is contrary to any of the provisions of the Constitution or of any law or which is made in excess or in abuse of powers vested in such organ or authority or person'. The Supreme Court has jurisdiction to declare such decision or act to be null and void and of no effect whatsoever or that the omission ought not to have been made and that whatever has been omitted should have been performed. The decision in question shall be binding on all courts and all organs or authorities in the Republic. Persons claiming to be victims of legislative measures of discrimination may attack the validity of such measures either through the above-mentioned procedure of a recourse directed against an administrative act or omission based on such legislative measures and affecting their legitimate interests, or by raising before any Court the question of unconstitutionality of such measures at any stage of judicial proceedings, civil or criminal, in which they are parties.\" \"The Constitution garantees the right of all Egyptians to apply to, and appear before, the courts.

In the field of education, the Constitutional Court considered that a provision which required an express declaration of exemption from courses of Catholic moral and religious education violated article 41, paragraphs 1 and 3, of the Constitution. Because the unconstitutionality decision has general binding force, this rule has been dropped from the Portuguese judicia system. Subsequently, an order (Port. 344-Â/88 of 19 December) was published, requiring a positive declaration for those who wanted to follow such courses.

Four members are chosen by the President of the United States, two members are chosen by the President pro tempore of the United States Senate, and two members are chosen by the speaker of the United States House of Representatives. The Commission on Civil Rights investigates allegations that citizens are being denied the right to vote because of religious or other discrimination, studies and collects information concerning legal developments constituting religious or other discrimination, appraises the laws and policies of the federal government with respect to religious and other discrimination, and serves as a clearinghouse for information in respect of religious and other discrimination. This statute establishes no new category of crimes but concerns collectic of information about actions which are otherwise criminal and which are motivated by or manifest evidence of prejudice based, inter alia, on religion.

If so» would vour Government welcome appropriate technical assistance from the Centre for Human Rights? \"The Government believes that Australian law and practice are in conformity with the Declaration. It is the Government's belief that, subject to the incidents brought to light by the National Inquiry into Racist Violence/ religious intolerance and discrimination are not significant problems in Australia. As stated above, the Government is currently examining the relevant changes proposed by that Inquiry. Apart from the possible need for such measures/ the view of the Australian Government is that existing laws and mechanisms are adequate to deal with incidents of religious intolerance when they occur and does not see a need for the revision of national legislation.\" \"At present the machinery and laws in place are adequate to protect discrimination based on religious or any other belief.\" \"Bolivian legislation is in line with the principles stated in the Declaration, guaranteeing freedom of religion and categorically prohibiting any form of intolerance or discrimination based on religion or belief. Nevertheless, Bolivia would have no objection to receiving any advice from the Centre for Human Rights designed to further the free practice of religion in the country.\" \"At present we do not think that there is any need to revise our laws. Indeed we believe that our Constitution provides adequate protection.\" \"Neither the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms nor human rights legislation contains as specific or detailed provisions concerning religious intolerance and discrimination as the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. However, in fact these two sources of human rights protection in Canada have been interpreted and applied in such a manner as to implement many of its provisions. Indeed, relevant international human rights instruments are taken into account in interpreting Canadian law. For example, in the Keegstra case referred to above, the Supreme Court о Canada referred to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms in concluding that the prohibition of hate propagand in the Criminal Code was constitutional. Furthermore, there are other legislative provisions in Canada than the Charter and human rights legislation which protect persons from religious intolerance and discrimination, such as the provisions outlined under question (g) above. The Government of Canada is, however, mindful of the importance of seeking to ensure that the basic principles set out in the Declaration are respected in a practical way in Canada. This is an area where there have bee major developments in Canada in recent years, and furthermore where it is important to ensure that progress continues. For example, it is just within the last few years that human rights legislation in Canada has been interpreted to preclude systemic as well as direct discrimination, and to include a doctrine of reasonable accommodation. The federal government is currently considering amending the Canadian Human Rights Act to provide express statutory recognition for these doctrines.\" \"It is believed that the guarantees against all forms of discrimination embodied in the legal system of Cyprus are both adequate and effective.\" \"The Egyptian Constitution and national legislation make provision for numerous citizens' rights as set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and are consistent with most international constitutions and legislative instruments that have been promulgated in this regard. Egypt participates in numerous human rights conferences and symposia at the regiona level (League of Arab States, Organization of African Unity) and also at the international level (United Nations).\" \"The Government of the Republic of Guinea does not just want to amend it national legislation, it is in the process of drafting a number of texts to bring that legislation closer into line with the international legal instruments on human rights. Any technical assistance by the Centre for Human Rights in this area would be warmly welcomed.\" \"Religious freedom is guaranteed under Haitian law. Any form of intolerance or discrimination based on religion or belief is considered a violation of law and order and a disturbance of the peace under Haitian law, which is based on the principles of the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief.\" \"It does not seem necessary.\" \"The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, within its legal duties and responsibilities may revise national legislation whenever it deems it appropriate and in accordance with the principles of Islam and the Constitution.\" \"The principles set forth in the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief are supported by the State of Israel. Israel's commitment to these principles is consistantly expressed in the statutes, in the judicial decisions and on every level of civil administration of the State. Therefore, the State of Israel does not find it necessary to receive assistance or to revise national legislation to reflect the aims of the Declaration. At the same time Israel is willing to cooperate with the Centre for Human Rights in helping to foster understanding for these principles throughout the world.\" \"Luxembourg legislation is in line with the principles stated in the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief.\" \"The Panamanian Government considers that it is not necessary to adopt new measures with regard to the fundamental principles stated in the Declaration on the Elimination because they are already guaranteed by Panamanian law. Nevertheless, we believe we could benefit from appropriate technical assistance provided by the Centre for Human Rights in this area.\" \"On the basis of the foregoing, it is possible to assert that the Portuguese legal system has long been in line with the principles set forth ii the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. The Constitution adopted in 1976 strengthened and clarified the principles of religious freedom, strongly influencing the ordinary legislatior passed since that date. As regards practice, the actual application of these legal provisions, the almost total lack of cases relating to any form of religious intolerance or of discrimination based on religion before the Portuguese courts is the most eloquent proof that the constitutional and legal principles and provisions are applied.\" \"Yes. Moreover, a draft designed to bring Rwandese legislation into line with the conventions, declarations, protocols and other international legal instruments on human rights is being prepared. The assistance of the Centre for Human Rights could be useful to us in drawing up this draft.\" \"Our Government would accept appropriate technical assistance from the Centre for Human Rights with regard to the principles set forth in the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief.\" \"Policy question.\" \"In this regard, current Turkish legislation is in full compliance with international norms. The Government of Turkey supports all efforts to eliminate intolerance and discrimination based on religion and belief at the international level.\" \"Legislative activity in the Ukrainian SSR in recent years has been aimed at the adoption in the Republic of laws corresponding as far as possible to universally recognized international standards on human rights, including religious rights and freedoms. The 1991 Act on freedom of conscience and religious organizations contains a series of articles consonant with the provisions of the 1981 Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief. In the opinion of the Ukrainian SSR, a significant shortcoming in the international legal mechanism for regulating this question is the absence of a treaty guaranteeing religious rights and freedoms. Important as the provisions of the 1981 Declaration are, they need to be couched in legally binding terms so that States could be called to account under international law if they were violated. In this regard, we endorse the recommendation of the Special Rapporteur to the Commission on Human Rights on the advisability of formulating a draft international convention on the elimination of all forms of intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief. The most acceptable way of formulating such a draft might be that tried and tested with the Convention Against Torture, the Convention on the Rights of the Child and some other documents, that is, to create an open-ended working group of the Commission on Human Rights.\" In its reply, the Government indicated that \"the Government of the United States believes its national laws are in full conformity with the principles set forth in the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief\". \"Our present legislation already caters for such eventualities.\"",

The Special Rapporteur has noted with concern the developments in matters relating to the freedom of religion or belief which occurred during the period under review as a result of the Gulf crisis. His attention was drawn to a number of specific incidents which occurred in relation to the members of the majority Shia religious community in Iraq and constitute an infringement of the provisions of the Declaration. They range from the enforced disappearance of numerous clergy and members of their families to the destruction and desecration of shrines, places of worship and cemeteries. 177. The Special Rapporteur has also noted with concern that members of the clergy belonging to various Christian denominations have continued to be subjected to intimidation and death threats and have been killed in a number of countries. Although it may sometimes be difficult to determine whether such persecution is based on religious or political motives, the Special Rapporteur nevertheless transmitted allegations concerning such incidents to the Governments of countries in which they had occurred with a view to obtaining clarifications. On the other hand, in connection with Commission resolution 1991/29, his attention was drawn to the situation of members of the Catholic clergy in Peru engaged in social work with underprivileged segments of the society who have been attacked and killed by members of armed groups that spread terror among the population. 178. The Special Rapporteur has also taken due note of resolution 1991/70, in which the Commission requested representatives of United Nations human rights bodies to continue to take urgent steps, in conformity with their mandates, to help prevent the occurrence of intimidation or reprisal as well as prevent access to United Nations human rights procedures being hampered in any way. However, during the period under review, no specific incidents or cases falling within the purview of resolution 1991/70 were reported to the Special Rapporteur. 179. Since his appointment, the Special Rapporteur has been collecting information regarding constitutional and legal guarantees of the freedoms enshrined in the 1981 Declaration and the measures taken by States to combat intolerance, as well as incidents and governmental actions which might be inconsistent with the provisions it contains. He has received this information from Governments, non-governmental organizations, as well as other, religious and lay, sources. As the Special Rapporteur already indicated in his previous report, the quantity and variety of this information has prompted him to select a number of questions which he considers of particular relevance to his mandate in order better to clarify certain situations which have been recurrent over the years. As indicated in chapter III of the present report, on 25 July 1990 he addressed a questionnaire containing 11 questions to all Governments with a view to finding out how they deal with such situations in their legislation and judicial and administrative practice. Section В of chapter III contains an analysis of their replies. 180.

The few relatively specific answers indicated a negative connotation attached to the notion of religious sects. This absence of precise definitions contrasted sharply with the Special Rapporteur's experience concerning so-called sects where these religious entities have not only been depicted in derogatory terms, but were openly persecuted and denied legal status on account of financial fraud, proselytism, heresy or simple lack of acceptance. Irrespective of the controversy which \"sects\" or \"new religious movements\" have caused in recent years, the Special Rapporteur maintains the position he adopted previously in carrying out his mandate, namely that the 1981 Declaration is the best instrument at the disposal of the international community allowing for a distinction to be made between legal and illegal practices of religious entities.",

Conscientious objectors should be exempted from combat but could be required to perform comparable alternative service of various kinds, which should be compatible with their reasons for conscientious objection, should such service exist in their country. To avoid opportunism, it would be acceptable if this service were at least as onerous as military service, but not so onerous as to constitute a punishment for the objector. They could also be asked to perform alternative service useful to the public interest, which may be aimed at social improvement, development or promotion of international peace and understanding. Conscientious objectors should be given full information about their rights and responsibilities and about the procedures to be followed when seeking recognition as conscientious objectors, bearing in mind that application for the status of conscientious objector has to be made within a specific time frame. The decision concerning their status should be made, when possible» by an impartial tribunal set up for that purpose or a by regular civilian court, with the application of all the legal safeguards provided for in international human rights instruments. There should always be a right to appeal to an independent, civilian judicial body.

As he has already indicated in his previous reports, the Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that States should continue actively to consider the usefulness of preparing a binding international instrument on the elimination of intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief. In addition, as recommended by Mr. Theo van Boven, expert of the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, in his working paper (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1989/32), this instrument should build on the standards already elaborated by the international community. The Special Rapporteur therefore urges States which have not already ratified the relevant international human rights instruments to do so and to make use of the machinery already available for monitoring their implementation.",

        "Text": "192. In addition, States should constantly monitor possible violations of the right to freedom of religion and belief and should endeavour to adapt their legislation to existing international standards, in particular the 1981 Declaration. In order to combat acts of religious intolerance and discrimination, they should establish the necessary constitutional and legal guarantees to protect the rights enshrined in the Declaration and should also envisage the introduction of appropriate mechanisms to ensure the effective implementation of these norms. The Special Rapporteur has noted the discrepancies that often exist between general provisions and the texts of laws and administrative decrees, which may result in measures infringing the right to freedom of religion and belief.",

In the light of the answers to the questionnaire that he has received from Governments, the Special Rapporteur is of the opinion that more decisive steps ought to be taken worldwide to introduce effective administrative and judicial remedies, of which victims of religious intolerance and discrimination should be able to avail themselves in the event of violation of the rights set out in the Declaration. These legal remedies should be clearly defined and should be particularly concerned with penalizing incidents and measures inconsistent with the standards concerned. The replies to the questionnaire have also pointed to the necessity to create national institutions to promote tolerance in matters of religion and belief, as well as the need to establish conciliation arrangements and other mechanisms dealing with disputes arising from acts of religious intolerance.",

        "Text": "194. The Special Rapporteur would like to underline the importance of promoting ideals of tolerance and understanding in matters of religion and belief through education by introducing national and international human rights standards in school and university curricula and through the training of the teaching staff. The advisory services and technical assistance offered by the Centre for Human Rights could make a very important contribution in this regard. The Special Rapporteur finally wishes to emphasize the significant role of media briefings and information seminars aimed at the broadest possible dissemination of the principles set out in the 1981 Declaration in encouraging greater understanding and tolerance as regards religion and belief.",
