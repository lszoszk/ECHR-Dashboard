In some cases, harm is defined in overly broad terms. Unfettered discretion has been given to executive authorities without judicial oversight in some legislation, notably in Malaysia and Singapore, opening the possibility for abuse and arbitrary decision-making.

In the age of the Me Too movement, both States and companies should confront gender disinformation online as a priority and also give special attention to its consequences in the real world. Companies should introduce appropriate policies, remedies and mechanisms that are tailored from a gender perspective across all aspects of the platform experience and that are designed in consultation with those affected by this pernicious behaviour. States should also integrate fully gendered perspectives into their policies and programmes to address disinformation and misinformation, including in media, information and digital literacy programmes.",
