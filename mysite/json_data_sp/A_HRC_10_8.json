On the central issue of school curricula, the Toledo Guiding Principles provide that curricula should be developed in accordance with recognized professional standards in order to ensure a balanced approach to study about religions and beliefs. The preparation and implementation of these curricula should be inclusive so as to give different stakeholders the opportunity to offer comments and advice. Moreover, attention should be given to key historic and contemporary developments pertaining to religion or belief, and curricula should reflect global and local issues. In addition, care should be taken to avoid inaccurate or prejudicial educational material, particularly when this reinforces negative stereotypes. Teachers have a prominent role to play implementing these curricula. They should first have a commitment to religious freedom that contributes to a school environment and practices which foster protection of the rights of others in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding among members of the school community. Furthermore, in accordance with the Toledo Guiding Principles, those who teach about religions or beliefs should be adequately educated to do so, in terms of both subject-matter competence and pedagogical skills, and they should also receive ongoing training for using the curricula.",

Violent acts perpetrated in the name of religion must not be extended to any form of impunity. Any legislation or policy designed to combat religious discrimination must be all-inclusive, carefully crafted and implemented in a balanced manner to achieve its objectives. There may yet be cases of intolerant religious behaviour that do not constitute violations of human rights but which may still give rise to religious polarization and disturb social cohesion. The Special Rapporteur specifically cautioned against excessive or vague legislation on such religious issues, which may create tensions and problems rather than solving them. From her mandate experience, she pointed out that the implementation of such national legislation had often fostered more polarization rather than protect religious minorities. Furthermore, she stressed that each particular case could only be adjudicated according to its own circumstances, and also referred to the role of the judiciary as vital in providing a means of legal redress to victims of human rights violations. In conclusion, she affirmed that more consultation was needed, especially concerning the implementation of existing standards at the domestic level. She suggested that the Human Rights Committee could revisit its general comment No. 11 (1983) on article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

In addition to initiatives in the field of education (see paragraphs 7-9 above), interreligious dialogue constitutes one of the principal means of countering sectarian attitudes and enhancing religious tolerance worldwide. It is a precious tool for preventing misunderstanding and violations in the area of freedom of religion or belief. Interreligious dialogue can also help activate the silent majority to look for common See A/51/542, annexes I and II; A/52/477/Add.1; A/53/279, annex; and E/CN.4/1999/58, annex. strategies on how to find harmony and peace.

With regard to participation in initiatives related to interreligious dialogue, the Special Rapporteur believes that it should not be limited to leaders of religious or belief communities, but be as inclusive as possible. Indeed, interreligious dialogue at the grass-roots level should be strongly encouraged and an exchange of views should, if possible, also include atheists and non-theists as well as believers who are dispassionate about their faith and members of religious minorities. Any dialogue would also greatly benefit from the perspectives of women, who tend to be marginalized in major events of interreligious dialogue. Indeed, although women are often subject to discrimination based on religion or belief, women's groups have been very effective human rights advocates across religious lines in situations of communal tensions. In addition, the Special Rapporteur believes that artists, including those in the visual media, may play an important role in public education regarding religious tolerance and in building bridges between different communities. Journalists and lawyers can also make a difference, especially when their statements and actions transcend religious lines. Politicians should also help to implement concrete actions aiming at promoting religious tolerance and mainstreaming religious diversity. In this regard, emphasis should be put on public awareness and education. They are particularly crucial in a world where technology plays a powerful role in building public opinion. In addition, prompt responses to acts of violence based on religion or belief are critical; they can either fan religious intolerance or can be constructive and calm rising tensions.

The Special Rapporteur acknowledges that the content of interreligious dialogue might potentially also give rise to controversy, in particular if it entails discussion on the respective religions and their theological approaches. As a result, there may be the temptation to look for dialogue only on non-contentious topics that are not directly related to theology, such as common environmental concerns. While debate on these topics is without doubt useful, the potential of interreligious dialogue to promote religious tolerance by improving understanding between and among members of religious or belief communities should not be neglected. Participants in interreligious dialogue might well be able to discuss the similarities and differences of their respective theological approaches.

It is desirable to institutionalize interreligious dialogue at various levels, in the right format and with a wide selection of participants, which still allows for a real exchange of views. Nonetheless, interreligious dialogue may also take place in rather informal settings. Natural spaces in pluralistic societies that encompass multicultural neighbourhoods, schools, clubs and other public services and which allow for constant interaction are conducive to true dialogue. In a society where there are no invisible boundaries on the basis of religion or belief, constant interaction is inevitable, which leads to dialogue and mutual understanding. In addition, the role of educational institutions in this regard seems to be vital; they can either inculcate a spirit of tolerance or promote tensions, even at an early age. The emphasis must therefore lie on enlightened education that teaches children to recognize and appreciate existing diversity. To that effect, the final document of the International Consultative Conference on School Education in relation to Freedom of Religion or Belief, Tolerance and Non-discrimination included the strengthening of a non-discriminatory perspective in education and of knowledge in relation to freedom of religion or belief at the appropriate levels as one of its objectives.",

At the heart of this problem lies the fact that discriminatory and harmful practices against women, such as female genital mutilation, polygamy, discrimination related to inheritance, sacred prostitution, general preference to have boys, are often perpetrated by individuals or communities who perceive them as a religious obligation or as being part of their freedom to manifest their religion or belief. However, the previous mandate-holder argued that religions have not invented discriminatory and harmful practices against women; rather, these practices are mainly attributable to a cultural interpretation of religious precepts. The concepts of culture and religion are, however, inextricably linked; it is therefore difficult to dissociate religion from culture or customs and traditions, since religion is itself a tradition. Nonetheless, he concluded that an important number of these discriminatory practices have decreased over time. This is mainly due to a wilful strategy of the State to tackle the root causes by modifying certain cultural schemes through reforms pertaining to, inter alia, all aspects of social and family life. The previous mandate-holder emphasized that, while certain traditional practices have ancestral origins, the Government nevertheless remains responsible to protect women from discriminatory practices perpetrated by individuals or communities on its territory.",

In this section, the Special Rapporteur provides a preliminary analysis on discrimination based on religion or belief and its impact on the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights. While focusing on economic, social and cultural rights in the present report, the Special Rapporteur recalls that the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action proclaimed that all human rights are universal, indivisible, and interdependent and interrelated. Therefore, the distinction made in this section between civil and political rights on the one hand, and economic, social and cultural rights on the other, should merely be seen as reflecting the terminology used by the two international covenants. 5 The Special Rapporteur prefers to use the term \"discrimination based on religion or belief\" rather than \"religious discrimination\", in order to emphasize that the prohibition of discrimination is not limited to theistic beliefs but also encompasses non-theistic or atheistic beliefs.

Indeed, discrimination not only occurs when individuals or groups in the same situation are treated differently, but may also occur when individuals or groups are treated in the same way although their situation is different. The principle of non-discrimination thus prohibits both unjustified distinctions when similar situations are treated differently and unjustified comparisons when different situations are treated in the same manner.",

On the basis of articles 2 and 4 of the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, three issues need to be emphasized. First, the principle of non-discrimination, as enshrined in the Declaration, applies to States as much as to non-State actors as potential perpetrators. States have therefore the duty to refrain from discriminating individuals or groups of individuals because of their religion and belief and must also take necessary measures to prevent and eliminate discrimination between non-State actors. Incidents among non-State actors tend to be less clear-cut than discrimination perpetrated by States. For instance, it may be difficult to determine whether faith-based associations are allowed to disregard employment applications from believers belonging to a different community or if they are compelled to consider all applicants, regardless of their religious affiliation. Another example is when a religious or belief community wishes to exclude a certain community from using its premises if these are usually available for rent. In order to determine whether these actions amount to discrimination or not, a case-by-case analysis is necessary.",

Hence, not all forms of distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference amount to discrimination; some may in fact be used in the context of special temporary measures or affirmative action, aiming at the elimination of conditions which cause or help to perpetuate discrimination, including on grounds of religion or belief. According to the Human Rights Committee, \"in a State where the general conditions of a certain part of the population prevent or impair their enjoyment of human rights, the State should take specific action to correct those conditions. Such action may involve granting for a time, to the part of the population concerned, certain preferential treatment in specific matters as compared with the rest of the population. However, as long as such action is needed to correct discrimination in fact, it is a case of legitimate differentiation under the Covenant\". The Special Rapporteur stresses that affirmative actions may be essential to empower communities that suffered on account of historic discriminatory practices. At the same time, she underlines that the effectiveness of affirmative action should be measured through various identifiable means and should be monitored for its progress.",

Indirect discrimination stems from a law, policy or practice that does not appear at first sight to involve inequalities but which inevitably leads to inequalities when implemented.

In the event that restrictions would be compatible with human rights, State agencies must nonetheless not apply them in a discriminatory manner or with a discriminatory purpose, for example by arbitrarily targeting certain communities or groups. The Special Rapporteur, however, emphasized that contentious situations need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by weighing the different rights, according to the circumstances of a given situation. She referred to pertinent international case law, including to the views of the Human Rights Committee on a communication related to the termination of the labour contract of a Sikh employee wearing a turban in his daily life and who refused to wear safety headgear during his work in a national railway company. In response to the employee's complaint that the company had discriminated against him on the basis of his religion, the Committee argued that \"legislation requiring that workers in federal employment be protected from injury and electric shock by the wearing of hard hats is to be regarded as reasonable and directed towards objective purposes that are compatible with the Covenant\".

While the prison authorities provided one hot meal per day, the detainee complained that, as a vegetarian, he most often could not eat it since the vegetables were covered with meat sauce. According to prison rules, specific food was provided to detainees only for medical reasons, and detainees had in any case the possibility to either buy cold snacks at the cafeteria or to receive specific food from their religious communities. However, the complainant argued that there was no local Hindu community available to accommodate his dietary needs. This example illustrates that discrimination can also occur when individuals are treated in the same way although their situation is different. The Special Rapporteur recalls that persons deprived of their liberty find themselves in a situation of enhanced vulnerability since prison authorities are given total control over the most basic activities of the inmates, including over what they eat.",

Although the scope of the law applied equally to all religious symbols, it turned out to disproportionately affect young Muslim women wearing the headscarf, thereby constituting a form of indirect discrimination. It also seriously affected members of the Sikh community, who reported that displaying religious symbols was an essential part of their faith. The implementation of this law led to the exclusion of children from the school public system and consequently hindered the right of some children to have access to educational institutions.

Monitoring compliance with anti-discrimination legislation by the private sector and offering quality public education also seem vital to promote the principle of non-discrimination in society. Furthermore, legal remedies must be provided to individuals in order to allow them to seek redress against discrimination based on religion or belief. In addition, States should envisage protective measures in favour of certain population groups, including religious minorities, to provide those who do not have sufficient means with equal access to basic services, such as health care or education.",

In order to take appropriate measures to remedy persistent inequalities and religious differentials in relation to all human rights, the Special Rapporteur recommends that States collect disaggregated data and that they encourage in-depth analyses pertaining to the socio-economic situation of religious and belief communities. However, she cautions against improper utilization of these data, which may further cluster the population into artificial categories and ultimately lead to a more polarized and intolerant society.",

        "Text": "61. All human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated. Consequently, there should not be a different approach between discrimination affecting the enjoyment of civil and political rights on the one hand, and discrimination affecting the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights on the other. As reiterated in several general comments by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the principle of non-discrimination in the enjoyment of the rights guaranteed by the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is not subject to the rule of the progressive realization of rights or to the availability of resources. It is immediately and fully applicable to all the rights guaranteed by the Covenant and encompasses all internationally prohibited grounds of discrimination.",

The entry into force of the Optional Protocol to the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recently adopted by the General Assembly should enable those suffering from violations of their economic, social and cultural rights to seek remedies and to hold those responsible to account for their actions. In a joint press statement of 10 December 2008, the Special Rapporteur and 35 other special procedures mandate-holders expressed their sincere hope that the views adopted by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights under the Optional Protocol procedures will be used by the human rights community to assist States in taking concrete steps to realize the rights of all and to reach out to the most marginalized and disadvantaged, who are the most likely to have their rights violated. In the view of the Special Rapporteur, the promotion of the realization of economic, social and cultural rights may ultimately contribute to enhancing religious tolerance and preventing discrimination. -----",
