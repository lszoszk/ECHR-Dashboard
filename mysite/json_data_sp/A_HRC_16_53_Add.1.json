Li has again been hospitalized for treatment in the prison infirmary since 23 September 2009, with a preliminary diagnosis of hypertension, gastritis and reflux oesophagitis, and is being treated with intravenous fluids and medications. - Outpatient treatments: When Li suddenly fainted in January 2005, the prison promptly arranged to have him treated at the provincial people's hospital; because he was frequently vomiting, the prison arranged outpatient treatment for him on 10 November and 19 December 2008, during which his gastritis and reflux oesophagitis were revealed by a CT scan. - On 3 March 2009, Li was admitted to the prison infirmary for dizziness, shortness of breath and coughing; he was diagnosed with hypertension, myocardial ischemia and an upper-respiratory infection, and was treated with oral medications. - On 6 May 2009, he was admitted to the prison infirmary for intermittent pain in the left thorax. He was diagnosed with an obsolescent myocardial infarction and treated with oral medications. - On 16 September 2009, he was admitted to the prison infirmary for recurrent chest constriction and shortness of breath; the diagnosis was hypertension and he was treated with oral medication.",

On 31 March 2006, Yu was approved for a twoyear, six-month term of re-education through labour by the Beijing Municipal Re-education Through Labour Administrative Committee. On 26 June 2006, Yu applied to the Beijing Municipal People's Government for an administrative review of that decision; the Beijing Municipal People's Government accepted the case for investigation, and upheld the original decision with regard to the applicant's re-education through labour. Because his domicile of origin was Hebei Province, Yu was transferred into the re-education through labour camp at Masanjia in Hebei Province on 21 May 2007. Yu had engaged in a hunger strike for a time at the Tuanhe labour camp in Beijing, and continued to refuse to eat after being transferred to the Masanjia labour camp.",

(a drug addict who had also been sentenced to re-education through labour and who had also been treated in the hospital) and others, and, through a recently admitted fellow-cultist, provided W. Y. with three saw blades after W. Y. had been released from the hospital. On 11 August 2008, W. Y. and Z. D. (sentenced to re-education through labour for employing cults, secret societies and superstitious activities to endanger society) escaped after sawing through the steel bars on a labour camp dormitory window. Yu also contacted his wife, who provided W. Y. and Z. D. with a hiding-place. In accordance with the provisions of article 24, paragraph 1 (1) (the re-education through labour terms of persons who escape or organize, incite or assist others to escape are to be extended by three months or more) and paragraph 2 (5) (the re-education through labour sentences of persons who conceal cash, weapons, ropes and other prohibited articles, and who refuse to surrender them, are to be extended by two to three months) of the Detailed Rules for Implementation of the Three Types of Administrative Model and of the Review and Reward System for Persons Undergoing Re-education Through Labour in Liaoning Province, their re-education through labour terms were extended by one year. Yu was released from re-education through labour on 2 September 2009. • With regard to the allegation that Yu was sent to a brainwashing centre at Luotaishanzhuang in Fushun City, investigation indicates that apart from a period of treatment in the Shenyang Masanjia labour camp infirmary for the adverse health effects of his hunger strike, Yu remained in that camp from the time he was transferred there from the Beijing Tuanhe labour camp on 21 May 2007 until his release from re-education through labour on 2 September 2009; during that time he was mainly receiving training on compliance with the legal system, and there is no evidence that he was ever sent to a brainwashing centre at Luotaishanzhuang in Fushun City. - With regard to the issue of his family members allegedly being refused permission to visit him, investigation indicates that from May 2007 to his release from hospital and return to the labour camp in August 2008, he received visits from members of his family as normal; such visits were subsequently terminated, however, because members of his family had facilitated his escape. - With regard to the issue of an alleged \"suicide note\", the labour camp had arranged for more than a year of hospitalization and treatment for the effects of his refusal of food and water as well as for his acute coronary syndrome, and he was not returned to the camp until he had recovered. Yu wrote a statement of repentance on 1 October 2008. The allegation that he had been forced to write a \"suicide note\" while in the labour camp has no basis in fact. - With regard to the issue of the alleged solitary confinement, investigation indicates that for structural reasons, even now there are no solitary-confinement facilities at the Masanjia labour camp, so the accusation that Yu was held in solitary confinement has no basis in fact. There is also no evidence of his ever having been subjected to corporal punishment or maltreatment.",

Indeed, the direct cause of the public unrest was the determination of the police to do their duty by protecting the accused, a Copt, who was implicated in a sexual attack upon a Muslim girl, and by protecting the members of his family, until such time as the accused was brought before the courts in order to allow the law to take its course and justice to be done in the ordinary way; - The Egyptian courts will conduct an entirely independent examination of the cases of G. and of the attacks committed in Farshout and will render their verdict in accordance with the Egyptian Criminal Code, if the charges are proven; - To date, there is no official record of the damage done to the property owned by Copts in Farshout, as the report of the local unit tasked by the Office of the Public Prosecutor with assessing the scale of the damage and the value of compensation owed to the aggrieved parties has yet to be issued; - The Farshout city local council held an emergency session at the beginning of the crisis to discuss all possible ways of defusing the tension. The members of the people's assembly and the elders' council and with the chiefs and sheikhs of Farshout took steps to mediate between the family of the girl and the Copts of the city.",

In the opinion accompanying its ruling, the Administrative Court made a number of comments, to which the Government of Egypt drew attention: - The safeguards and firmly established principles enshrined in the Egyptian Constitution guarantee citizens freedom of religion, belief and worship and grant every citizen the right to adhere to any religion or belief or to convert to another religion. However, formal procedures are not a private matter but rather a separate issue. Procedures are regulated by law in order to prevent any threats or risks being posed to public order (ordre public). This is not inconsistent with article 18, paragraph 3, of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; - In connection with the above, there is no doubt that persons who change their religion on bogus grounds or for the sake of personal gain can stir up unrest, which threatens security, social peace and public order. It is also a fact that Mohammed Ahmed Abduh Hegazy has been a defendant in four court cases, the most recent being Port Said Administrative Court Case No. 1064/2006, in which Mr. Hegazy was indicted for assault and vandalism. In addition, Mr. Hegazy's former lawyer, who filed the case, held a press conference at the Kalimah Centre for Human Rights in August 2009. On that occasion, he announced that he was withdrawing from the case, because Mr. Hegazy's conversion to Christianity was not credible and, indeed, Mr. Hegazy had not provided any church authority with documentary evidence attesting to his desire to convert. This is consistent with Mr. Hegazy's reputation for seeking attention and trying to make personal gain by all possible means; - On 30 May 2009, Mohammed Hegazy filed another court case with the State Council (Case No. 41935, judicial year 63) against the President of the Republic and others, challenging the decision not to change the details in his identity card and demanding that the Civil Status Department be compelled to register his name as Bishoy Aramea Paulus and his religion as Christianity. In the event of a refusal, he asked for his name to be changed and the details of his religious affiliation to be deleted and replaced with the symbol (-). The case began before the Council on 12 July 2009; - The court bench, presided over by the Deputy President of the State Council, decided on 17 February to set a date of 27 April 2010 for the delivery of a verdict; - The allegation in the letter that fatwas were issued threatening Mr. Hegazy's life is belied by the statement made in June 2007 by the Grand Mufti of Egypt, Mr. Ali Gomaa, to the effect that conversion from Islam is a grave sin but should not be subject to temporal punishment. In addition, Mr. Abd al-Mu`ti Bayumi, a member of the Islamic Research Academy at Al-Azhar al-Sharif, together with other imams and academics at Al-Azhar, have confirmed that Islam respects freedom of belief and freedom of choice. Others have clarified particular aspects of the penalty for apostasy, stating that it is not applicable in all circumstances but rather when the act of apostasy is compounded by hostility and threats to Islam and society. Furthermore, the courts have dismissed several cases in which lawyers asked for the State to impose the penalty for apostasy on Muslims who had converted to another religion; - As an Egyptian national, Mohammed Hegazy enjoys a full range of rights and constitutional guarantees that enable him to use all available legal and judicial remedies. This may offer him some reassurance, should he feel that his life is in danger. Moreover, criminal proceedings may be brought against anyone who illtreats him or threatens his life, the lives of his family members or his home. Hegazy has not filed any reports indicating that he has gone into hiding because of threats that he has received. Moreover, he can leave the country at any time, using his current passport without having to wait for his personal details to be changed.",

Should any problem arise in connection with any aspect of this issue, the Egyptian courts will serve as an effective mechanism, offering remedies and protecting the rights and fundamental freedoms of citizens. In this connection, the Government of Egypt noted that, on more than one occasion, the administrative courts have played an important role in upholding human rights in general and religious freedoms in particular. A famous example was the judgement rendered by the Supreme Administrative Court on 9 February 2008 in favour of plaintiffs who had converted to Christianity. The judgement was upheld by the State Council and required the executive authorities to issue new identity papers to the plaintiffs. Another example is a judgement issued in favour of a person who converted to the Baha'i faith. Further to that judgement, an implementing regulation of the Ministry of the Interior was amended to allow for the inclusion of the symbol (-) in the space marked \"religion\" in identity papers.",

However, the Government indicated that the notion of human dignity was another well-defined notion in the Hungarian legal system, with numerous interpretative decisions by the Hungarian Constitutional Court, the former media authority and the Hungarian courts. Moreover, human dignity was explicitly referred to in the European audiovisual media legislation, particularly in the Directive on Audiovisual Media Services and in related recommendations by the European Parliament and the Council. The concept was also present in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights. As a consequence, the legal concept of \"human dignity\" had become instrumental in combating racism, xenophobia and hate speech in Europe.

Under the legal regime of Act 11 of 1986 on the Press (the relevant act in force prior to the adoption of the Press and Media Act and Media Services and the Mass Media Act), journalistic sources did not enjoy any special protection in the context of criminal proceedings. In the light of this, the Government was convinced that the provisions of the Press and Media Act regarding the right of journalists to protect their sources of information could not be described as a \"regressive step\" in any way.",

The Hungarian legislation provided substantial guarantees to ensure their independent conduct in their office: in performing their duties, members of the Media Council could not take orders from anyone; they could not be recalled; and they had to comply with strict rules on conflict of interest. The elected members of the Media Council were expected to have no ties – either formal or informal – to any political party, or to the Government.

In the relief camps of the port town of Nagapattinam, Dalits were allegedly not being allowed to drink water from tanks placed by UNICEF. In the tsunami-hit areas, food and cash distributions normally took place in Hindu temples, often the only structures still standing because they were built from solid granite. Reports indicated that Dalits were left out in these distributions due to the fact that as \"untouchables\" they were not allowed to enter the halls of worship.

According to the information received, on 10 January 2010, approximately 100 people, consisting of villagers and local officials, including the village chief, an official from the Lao Front for National Construction (LFNC), district police and village policemen, disturbed the Sunday morning worship service of the Christian community in Katin village of Ta-Oyl district, Saravan province. With guns pointed at the worshippers' heads, these officials allegedly forced all members of the 11 Christian families present, including children, out of their place of worship to an open field in the village. Subsequently, the officials seized the personal belongings of the Christians from 11 homes and destroyed 6 of their homes. While they did not manage to persuade the Christians to renounce their faith, the officials forced the Christians to walk six kilometers away from their homes and then left them on the side of the road. Unable to return to their home village due to police posted at the entrance of Katin village, the Christians, including women and 27 children, have been sleeping on the ground in the woods with no food and shelter.",

The two officials argued that neither the 56 villages in Ta-Oyl district nor the officials want Christians to reside in the district. However, the Christians confirmed their faith and emphasized that since they believe in God they no longer had to participate in any animal sacrifice as animist believers would do. The two officials then prohibited the members of the 11 Christian families from returning to their home village.",

International human rights law provides that States which retain the death penalty can only impose it for \"the most serious crimes\". As observed by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the conclusion to be drawn from a thorough and systematic review of the jurisprudence of all of the principal United Nations bodies charged with interpreting the \"most serious crimes\" provision, is that a death sentence can only be imposed in cases where it can be shown that there was an intention to kill which resulted in the loss of life (see A/HRC/4/20, para. 53).

Police in attendance threatened Mr. Sung Cua Po, saying that unless he renounced his Christian faith they would beat him to death and then seize his property, leaving his widowed wife and fatherless children homeless. Under pressure and fearful for his life, Mr. Sung Cua Po signed renunciation papers provided by the police, indicating that he rejected Protestant Christianity and would return to his \"traditional beliefs\". He was told not to associate with, visit or speak on the phone with other Christians. Mr. Sung Cua Po was also subjected to additional social pressure, family and clan \"fines\" and spirit rites to appease the traditional Hmong spirits, whom the villagers believe have been offended by the family's conversion to Christianity. Mr. Sung Cua Po reportedly remains under threat of death unless he voluntarily offers sacrifices to his ancestors on 13 February 2010, i.e. Eve of the Tet New Year. However, completing these sacrificial rites at the Tet festival would reportedly be incompatible with the Christian faith.",
