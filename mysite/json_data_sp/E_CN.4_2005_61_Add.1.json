Despite a constitutional right to perform alternative service and the State's commitment to the Council of Europe to introduce a law regulating such alternative service, for which the deadline had long expired, Mr. Bagirov, aged 28, had reportedly failed to secure this right in two court hearings. Reports indicated that he had lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court but fears had been expressed that he could have been sent to a military unit at any time. According to the information received, Mr. Bagirov was called up in 2000 and informed the recruitment office that he wished to perform alternative service because of his faith. Although his application received no response, he received a three-year deferment as he had started studies. He was called up again in May 2004 and ordered to report to a military unit. On 9 June 2004, he lodged his suit at the Baku Khatai district court, arguing that the obligation to perform military service was in violation of article 76, Part 2, of the Constitution, which provides that: \"If the beliefs of citizens come into conflict with service in the army then in some cases the law can permit alternative service instead of regular army service.\"",

This decision was reportedly taken at a high-level meeting held on 7 January 2004 at the Ministry of Religious Affairs chaired by the State Minister for Religious Affairs.

On 3 November 2004, the Special Rapporteur sent a communication to the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea regarding information received according to which parents were reportedly afraid to pass on their faith to their children, as sporadic refugee accounts suggested believers were still punished for practising their faith in secret. Churches in the Democratic People's Republic lead an entirely underground existence, meeting in unpopulated areas of the countryside to evade bugging in homes or informants. It is often as refugees in China that citizens of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea first encounter religious life. Refugees repatriated from China have reported that they were interrogated about their contacts with mainly Protestant missionaries from the Republic of Korea, while the Koreans in the north have reportedly set up a fake Protestant Church in China to lure back defectors. In particular, a general in the army of the Democratic People's Republic who became a Christian was, after he had begun to evangelize in his unit, shot dead by another senior army officer in 2003. Other known Christians are in some cases shot or imprisoned. It was also reported that religious persons, particularly Christians, who are imprisoned are subjected to worse treatment than other prisoners. Prison guards sometimes allegedly offer material incentives to Christian prisoners if they recant their faith.",

It is a fact that the mushrooming of many new religious bodies within the Fijian community in particular has caused strain in relations within Fiji. These organizations have been the main catalyst for the breakdown in the orderly running of many villages and communities of rural Fiji. The Government considers that such a trend is not only new and foreign, but has also increased the burden of ensuring law and order amongst rural Fijians. The Fiji Council of Churches (to which all religious bodies are affiliated) is well aware or this difficulty.",

Ce régime de séparation ou laïcité n'est en aucun cas à confondre avec une attitude anti-religieuse. II trace une ligne de partage claire entre, d'une part, ce qui relève de la conscience individuelle ou des choix personnels et, d'autre part, ce qui relève de l'Etat. Cette conception de la laïcité a deux implications principales. Premièrement, l'Etat français ne porte pas d'appréciation sur le contenu religieux de tel ou tel mouvement. II se refuse même à définir ce qui est ou n'est pas religieux. La liberté de conscience et de pratique religieuse s'applique donc à tous. Les pouvoirs publics ont cependant le devoir de sanctionner des agissements frauduleux dénoncés devant la justice, quels que soient les auteurs de ces agissements. Dans ces conditions, ce ne sont ni la croyance, ni la foi qui est visées, mais bien le fait répréhensible au titre de la loi. Deuxièmement, il n'existe pas, en France, de système d'enregistrement ou de reconnaissance des religions auprès des autorités publiques. Aucun primat ou traitement privilégié n'est accordé à un culte particulier. La proclamation par une association, constituée en vertu de la loi du 1er juillet 1901 (qui concerne les associations de toute nature), de sa qualité religieuse n'entraîne aucun privilège, notamment en qualité de legs ou d'imposition. Certes, il existe un statut d'association cultuelle (loi du 9 décembre 1905), dont l'obtention dépend du Ministère de l'intérieur (décret préfectoral), sous le contrôle du juge administratif. Mais l'obtention de ce statut ne conditionne en rien l'exercice du culte. II ne porte que sur l'octroi ou non d'avantages fiscaux, largement consentis, pour peu que deux conditions, rappelées par le Conseil d'Etat en 1997, soient remplies : une association cultuelle doit respecter l'ordre public et «agir seulement en vue de l'expression d'un culte», ce qui exclut toute activité commerciale.",

It was reported that on 13 January 2004, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Sangh Parivar declared a day of protest, allegedly accusing Christians of the murder. It was alleged that groups related to the Sangh Parivar held processions in different towns during which effigies of the bishop and priests were burnt, slogans against Christianity were shouted, and inflammatory leaflets against Christianity were distributed. On 14 January, a large crowd allegedly entered the campus of the Catholic Mission School in Jhabua and several priests were beaten, and significant material damage was incurred.

Inhabitants of the predominantly Christian village, many of whom are second- or third-generation Bhil converts, reportedly started throwing stones at the attackers, forcing them to flee.

Reports indicated that access to the field was blocked when 4,000 Baptists arrived from all over Central European Russia for the gathering on the morning of 21 August 2004. Vasili Ryzhuk, a local resident arrested several times for his beliefs, was reportedly arrested and taken to a nearby police station as he started to pray. He was released when Mr. Ryzhuk, who suffers from a heart condition, began to feel ill. According to the information received, the whole operation was conducted in accordance with a local instruction dated 20 August entitled \"On Measures to Prevent Events of a Religious Nature Taking Place in Lyubuchany Village\", which prohibited \"unsanctioned events of a religious nature\" in the village during the period from 20 to 31 August 2004. On 13 September 2004, the Lyubuchany Baptist community prayer house was reportedly destroyed by fire in unexplained circumstances.",

On 24 July 2004, the second day of their annual congress of the Urals region, more than 5,000 Jehovah's Witnesses were reportedly forced to leave the Yekaterinburg city stadium, which they had rented for the event. Reports indicated that the religious organization had held a congress at that venue every year since 1996. However, it was alleged that the Jehovah's Witnesses had been experiencing problems from the first day of the 2004 event. According to the information received, the assistant director of the stadium suddenly claimed that the rental fee of 100,000 roubles, which had already been paid in full, had not been authorized and did not reflect the stadium's actual expenses for staging the event. The Jehovah's Witnesses refused to pay a further 400,000 roubles, arguing that they had concluded a valid legal contract for the original sum with the stadium's director on 1 June 2004. In response, the assistant director allegedly threatened to halt the congress and, when delegates arrived on Saturday morning, access to the stadium was reportedly blocked by 10 young men claiming to be private security guards. However, as these men had neither E/CN.4/2005/61/Add.1 Page 53 uniform nor authorized documentation, the delegates entered the stadium. The electricity had been switched off and the power supply room locked, but the Jehovah's Witnesses continued the congress with a portable generator. It was further alleged that, on the Saturday morning, the 1,000 delegates were evicted from their accommodation. Finally, on the afternoon of the 24 July 2004, the stadium administration played loud music to disrupt the congress and then, with the help of security guards, forced the delegates to disperse. After a brief meeting, a committee of Jehovah's Witness leaders decided to cancel the congress in order to avoid further trouble.",

Officially accused of using drugs and praying to Jesus Christ, Mr. O'Connor was allegedly arrested by the Mutawa, the Saudi religious police, and taken to the Ali Hira prison in Riyadh, where he was threatened with death if he did not convert to Islam. During his detention, Mr. O'Connor was also reportedly subjected to torture. At the time of the communication, it was reported that he was detained in the Olaya prison. By letter dated 12 August 2004, the Government of Saudi Arabia expressed its astonishment at this unsubstantiated and exaggerated allegation, which was reportedly first published in an official Vatican newspaper on 2 June 2004 and subsequently referred to the Office of the High Commissioner in spite of its inadmissibility as a concrete and credible complaint. The Government indicated that it was evident that this allegation was totally unrealistic as no person living in Saudi Arabia had ever been subjected to duress with a view to inducing him to change his religion. However, it was not unprecedented for a foreign worker in the Kingdom to attempt to evade punishment for a criminal offence by falsely claiming to have been victimized, prosecuted and discriminated against on account of his religious belief.",

Upon his arrival at King Fahd International Airport in Dammam, on a flight from Teheran, he was arrested by officials of the General Directorate of Investigation (Mabahith), a branch of the Saudi Ministry of the Interior. The officials did not show any arrest warrant or other relevant decision by a public authority, nor did they orally inform Khalid Ahmed Al-Eleq about the reasons for his arrest. At the time of the communication, he was detained at the Mabahith headquarters in Dammam and no information on the reasons for the arrest or the charges preferred against him had been released. His family had been allowed to visit him twice. According to the information received, the detention was motivated by the Saudi authorities' determination to repress the teaching and learning of Shi'ah religious studies, as also evidenced by the ban on the establishment of learning centres for that purpose. In this respect, it was alleged that it was a widespread practice of the Saudi authorities to arrest Saudi citizens who were Shi'ah Muslims returning from religious studies in Iran, to detain them without charges for long periods and to subject them to ill-treatment while in detention. This practice allegedly persisted, notwithstanding the lifting of the ban on travelling to Iran in 2001.",

It was alleged that all the religious communities recognized by this bill were essentially mono-ethnic and that the bill therefore discriminated against \"multi-ethnic\" religious communities and would thus be unconstitutional. The Serbian Orthodox Church was given the status of primus inter pares (first among equals). The remaining recognized faith communities were the Catholic Church, the Islamic faith community, the Jewish religious community, the Slovak Lutheran and Hungarian/German Lutheran Churches, and the Hungarian Reformed Church. Reports indicated that the draft bill gave clergy of these Churches and religious communities substantial rights in terms of social security, pensions, salary support for communities in remote areas, access to local communities' building funds, rights to perform marriages and burials and to maintain marriage registers. Moreover, the status of a \"traditional\" faith was given to those communities recognized by parliament in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1918-1941). However, although some other minor Churches such as the Baptists and the Mennonites were reportedly recognized at that time, they were not given the status of a \"traditional\" faith in the draft bill. It was further alleged that article 17 of the bill would grant to clergy of these \"traditional\" communities the same immunity as enjoyed by parliamentary deputies and judges.",

The Supreme Court supported the contention of the petitioner that an organization established to propagate Christianity by providing material and other benefits, thereby converting such recipients to the said religion, would affect the very existence of Buddhism and breach article 9 of the Constitution. The Court, considering the terms set out in clause 3 of the bill, held that such a clause would be inconsistent with articles 9 and 10 of the Constitution. Therefore, the bill required approval by a two-thirds majority of Parliament and a referendum. Concerns have been expressed that this part of the judgment, which referred to article 9 of the Constitution, would give those who promote Buddhism an unfair advantage over those who seek to promote other religions. However, it was submitted that if a person sought to incorporate a Buddhist organization that offered social or economic benefits along with religious instruction, it might also be struck down in the same fashion as the bills seeking to incorporate a Christian organization because article 9 operates subject to the rights of all religions under article 10 and article 14(1)(e), which guarantee freedom of religious worship. Article 9 only prescribes a duty for the State to foster Buddhism and thereby give expression to the historic and the cultural ethos and aspirations of Sri Lanka, without prejudice to any other religion or belief.",

Archbishop Jovan had been previously arrested on 20 July 2003 for attempting to perform a baptism in a Macedonian Orthodox Church. The arrests reportedly took place in the apartment of Archbishop Jovan's father, where the service was taking place. The apartment had been turned into a small chapel with the name 'The Ascension of the Lord'. All those arrested were allegedly held in custody for 24 hours. After his release, Archbishop Jovan was reportedly re-arrested and sentenced to 30 days' \"investigative detention\" and the Bulgarian student was deported and banned from entering the country for two years. Archbishop Jovan has reportedly been charged with \"dissemination of national, racial and religious hatred, disorder and segregation\". The monks and nuns arrested would allegedly be charged with \"disturbance of public peace and order\".",

Article 19 of the Constitution guarantees the right to express one's faith freely and publicly, individually or in community with others. All religious communities are equal, i.e. have equivalent legal status. Religious communities and religious groups are separate from the State and are equal before the law. Freedom of religion is elaborated in greater detail in the Law on Religious Communities and Religious Groups of 1997, which regulates issues in the field of the legal status and work of religious communities and religious groups. Upon the initiative of certain religious groups and of the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights of the Republic of Macedonia, in 1998 and in 1999 the Constitutional Court abolished several articles of the Law which regulated issues related to the status, conditions for registration and activities of religious communities and religious groups. Currently, there are initiatives for the adoption of a new law for the regulation of religious freedoms and the rights of the citizens of Macedonia. Following a brief presentation of the history of the country with regard to freedom of religion or belief, the Government provided information on the current situation. In 2002, there were intensive talks between the Serbian and the Macedonian Orthodox Churches, as well as with other Orthodox Churches, for the recognition of the Macedonian Orthodox Church. The Universal Patriarch recommended that the Macedonian Orthodox Church negotiate with the Serbian Orthodox Church. In this context, several meetings were held and the result was the Nis Agreement, signed by the three bishops of the Macedonian Orthodox Church (Jovan, Petar and Naum) which, according to them, did not constitute an agreement but a basis for further negotiations. This agreement, in which the Macedonian Orthodox Church is referred to as the Ohrid Archdiocese, is accepted neither by the Macedonian Orthodox Church nor by its followers and has caused great dissatisfaction, being seen as damaging for the Macedonian Orthodox Church and for the Macedonian people. Ever since, the relations between the two Orthodox Churches have been very strained. The Holy Hierarch Synod of the Macedonian Orthodox Church and the Commission for Relations with Religious Communities and Groups recommended continuation of the talks but under the condition that the name of the Macedonian Orthodox Church and its autocephalous status would not be subject to negotiation.",

The request for the institution of misdemeanour charges also concerned four other persons. The Bitola First Instance Court heard the suspects and the proposed witnesses after which, in decision PRK No. 4703 dated 21 July 2003, the court decided to institute misdemeanour charges on the reasonable suspicion that on 20 July 2003 at 9 p.m., Zoran Vraniskovski went to St. Dimitrija Church in Bitola accompanied by his relatives to perform a religious ceremony - baptizing his nephew. After being told by the priest, Dirna Tanevski, that he could not perform religious ceremonies since he was no longer a priest, Vraniskovski and his relatives began to shout and display improper behaviour, violating the public peace and order, by which they committed an offence under article 4 of the Law against Violations of the Public Peace and Order. Employees of the Konzul security agency were called and since Vraniskovski refused to leave the church, police intervention was requested. Police officers immediately arrived and were prevented from performing their duties by Vraniskovski and the other persons who pushed them and refused to obey their order to leave the premises. At the Bitola Internal Affairs Department they offended and insulted the officers, by which they committed an offence under article 15, paragraphs 1,2 and 4, and article 16 of the Law against Violations of the Public Peace and Order.

In this respect, the Government underlined the fact that the penal provisions of the Macedonian legislation do not envisage the measure of solitary confinement that is mentioned in the letter of the Special Rapporteur as being prescribed for Vraniskovski and therefore it was not possible to impose such a measure.",

Later that evening, another police officer went to his house, presenting himself as the new local policeman and saying that he had come to get to know him. At 11 p.m. the following evening, a group of people knocked on his door. One of them introduced himself as the local policeman, although he was not the same man as the previous day.

The rate of those offences then dropped precipitously within a few weeks until, as of mid-January 2002, the rate had nearly returned to the low rate prevailing prior to 11 September.

With regard to the alleged several cases of attacks or planned attacks on places of worship referred to by the Special Rapporteur, the Government reported that on 19 November 2001, four individuals went to the Gobind Sadan temple, associated with the Sikh religion, in Oswego, New York. The individuals carried out acts of criminal mischief and two of them set fire to the building, resulting in more than \\$125,000 in damage. Following a joint investigation conducted by the New York State Police, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, authorities determined that these acts had been committed in retribution for the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. Two individuals were charged with felony counts of criminal mischief and were sentenced to jail sentences, probation, and fines of \\$1,000. In May 2002, the other two individuals were charged with arson and reckless endangerment and were sentenced to 3-12 years' imprisonment.",

With regard to the allegations of employment discrimination, the Government indicated that between 11 September 2001 and 11 February 2004, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) received 904 charges by individuals alleging that they were victims of backlash discrimination by individuals who are or who are perceived to be Muslim, Arab, Afghani, Middle Eastern, South Asian, Sikh, or other groups that might be the target of such actions following the events of 11 September 2001. The two most common allegations in those charges were harassment and discharge. Thus far, the EEOC had recovered over \\$2.2 million in monetary benefits for individuals aggrieved by post-9/11 backlash discrimination in employment through its enforcement, mediation, conciliation, and litigation efforts. The Commission is a five-member body that enforces Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Its mission is to eliminate unlawful employment discrimination, including religious discrimination. It has been at the forefront of the federal Government in conducting vigorous outreach and education to both the employer and labour communities at the national and grass-roots levels to prevent such discrimination and promote voluntary compliance with the law. Title VII prohibits employers from discriminating against individuals because of their religion in hiring, firing, and other terms and conditions of employment. Title VII covers employers with 15 or more employees, including state and local governments. It also applies to employment agencies and to labour organizations, as well as to the federal Government. Under Title VII, employees cannot be forced to participate--or not participate--in a religious activity as a condition of employment. Employers must reasonably accommodate employees' sincerely held religious beliefs or practices unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the employer.",

        "Text": "313. The Government indicated that a reasonable religious accommodation is any adjustment to the work environment that will allow the employee to practise his religion. An employer is not required to accommodate an employee's religious beliefs and practices if doing so would impose an undue hardship on the employer's legitimate business interests. An employer can show undue hardship if accommodating an employee's religious practices requires more than ordinary administrative costs, diminishes efficiency in other jobs, infringes on other employees' job rights or benefits, impairs workplace safety, causes co-workers to carry the accommodated employee's share of potentially hazardous or burdensome work, or creates a conflict with another law or regulation. Employers must permit employees to engage in religious expression if employees are permitted to engage in other personal expression at work, unless the religious expression would impose an undue hardship on the employer. Therefore, an employer may not place more restrictions on religious expression than on other forms of expression that have a comparable effect on workplace efficiency. Employers must also take steps to prevent religious harassment of their employees. In fiscal year 2002 (1 October 2001 – 30 September 2002), the EEOC received 2,572 charges alleging religious discrimination. The Commission resolved 2,729 religious discrimination charges and recovered \\$4.3 million in monetary benefits for charging parties and other aggrieved individuals (not including monetary benefits obtained through litigation).",

This was part of a broader effort to help the FBI develop a more comprehensive and meaningful set of performance measures for field offices. Out of dozens of questions in the survey, one asked the total number of mosques in the area covered by each field office. This informational survey was intended simply to gather facts on vulnerabilities. Information on mosques could not and would not be used to measure the terrorist threat or to set investigative goals. Rather, the question was designed to help paint a broad picture of local demographics and vulnerabilities to terrorism.

It received numerous notifications and warnings from the local justice department and as well as from the governing board and headquarters of the Evangelical Baptist organization of Uzbekistan. However, the Khorezm Church ignored them all. It continued to violate laws and regulations, including those concerning the involvement of children in religious activities without the consent of their parents, establishing an unlawful library and disseminating illegal literature among children and other people and other violations of, in particular, the provisions of the Law on \"Freedom of conscience and religious organizations\". Pastor Oleg Bader participated in the perpetration of these violations. On 27 November 2003, the Evangelical Baptist Church in Urgench City was fined five times the minimum monthly wage. The fine reportedly did not affect Mr. Bader directly but only his organization. Moreover, on 27 February 2004, the Justice Department of Khorezm Province decided to discontinue the registration of this organization and it was closed down.",

The issue of freedom of belief and registration of religious organizations was addressed as follows: \"Representatives of various religions live in Uzbekistan and all the citizens are free to profess their religious beliefs. This is guaranteed by the Constitution and country's laws. \"The adoption of the Law on 'Freedom of conscience and religious organizations' in 1991 and its revision in 1998 resulted in a qualitative change in the role and legal status of religious organizations. The aim of this Law is to secure and guarantee the freedoms and rights of conscience and belief for everyone, to maintain equality among citizens regardless of their religious beliefs, and to regulate issues related to the activities of religious organizations. \"It is worth mentioning that in 1990 only 211 religious organizations were registered in Uzbekistan. Currently, more than 2,000 religious organizations are registered in Uzbekistan, 1,955 of them Islamic, 170 Christian, 7 Jewish, 6 Bahá'í communities, 2 Krishna consciousness communities and 1 Buddhist temple. All believers and religious organizations are free to set up and maintain international links and direct private contacts, including trips abroad for pilgrimage, participating in seminars and conferences. \"Since independence about 40,000 citizens of Uzbekistan have performed the pilgrimage to Mecca (big Haj) and 20,000 the small Haj (Umrah). It should be mentioned that during the whole period of Soviet rule the number of pilgrims from Uzbekistan was only 86 men. Over this period the number of mosques has increased from 89 to more than 2,000 thousand. \"There are an Islamic University, a Higher Clerical Institute, 10 Islamic madrasas and 2 seminaries in Uzbekistan, where representatives of the new generations pursue their education. \"Moreover, on 22 August 2003, the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Uzbekistan issued Decree No. 364 on rendering of social assistance and privileges for further improvement of spiritual and educational work in the religious sphere and the realization of an action plan on the protection of the people, especially the youth, from the threat of religious terrorism.\"",

In March 1999, Mr. Tuong returned to secular life and married Tran Thi Hoang Oanh, his second wife. On 26 July 2002, he was arrested at Tay Ninh frontier as he tried to cross the border illegally in an attempt to contact and coordinate with certain foreign organizations for activities against the State of Viet Nam.

The Programme has recorded fruitful outcomes over the past years. Basic infrastructure in mountainous areas has been built and improved significantly, which helps promote the development of a multisectoral economy. The economic structure in various areas has been transformed in the direction of commodity production, which gradually lays the basis for socio-economic development along the line of industrialization and modernization. Especially, remarkable progress has been seen in social and economic development and the improvement of people's physical and spiritual conditions in the Central Highland provinces. The rights of people of all ethnicities in the Central Highlands are guaranteed. Socio-economic programmes to meet the need for productive and housing land of ethnic minority people are actively implemented. Recently, the National Assembly has amended the Land Law, providing the local governments with a legal basis for addressing the issue and provide adequate land for cultivation and housing of the people. This task is given special attention in the Central Highlands provinces. Viet Nam's law ensures the right to freedom of religion and belief and non-religion and belief of all citizens, which is clearly enshrined in the Constitution and respected in reality. There is absolutely no question of the so-called \"repression of Protestants\". On the contrary, Protestants in the Central Highlands enjoy favourable conditions for religious practices.
