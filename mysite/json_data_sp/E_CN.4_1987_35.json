However, despite the fact that the right to freedom of religion and of belief is recognized as one of the fundamental human rights in several international instruments, it has to be acknowledged that the phenomenon of intolerance in matters of conviction or belief continues to be a disturbing feature in many regions of the world. Admittedly, the phenomenon is an age-old one which has already caused the loss of many lives by bringing about many wars and savage repression throughout human history. Moreover, it is somewhat paradoxical that such manifestations of intolerance have occurred in the name of religions and convictions, most of which advocate first and foremost respect for human values and love of one's neighbour. In this connection, the fact cannot be disregarded that the followers of a particular religion or belief often tend to consider it to be the only valid manifestation of the truth. This characteristic, which amounts to a denial of the right of everyone to be different, is undoubtedly one of the root causes of intolerance and discrimination based on religion or belief. A number of other causes have also been recorded, including prejudice, since socio-ethnic characteristics often make religion a vital identity factor, or the need to identify a scapegoat responsible for various social and economic evils.",

They include, inter alia, the Study of Discrimination in the Matter of Religious Rights and Practices submitted in 19 59 by Mr. Arcot Krishnaswami, Special Rapporteur of the Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities V , and the report undertaken by Mrs. Elizabeth Odio Benito (E/CN.4/Sub.2/1987/26), also mandated by the Sub-Commission, on the root causes and current dimensions of the problems of intolerance and of discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief. Similarly, the United Nations Seminar on the Encouragement of Understanding, Tolerance and Respect in Matters Relating to Freedom of Religion or Belief, organized by the Centre for Human Rights at Geneva from 3 to 14 December 1974 (ST/HR/SER.A/16), also helped to determine the roots and nature of manifestations of intolerance in matters of religion or belief. The purpose of this report is not therefore to analyse the causes of religious intolerance, but rather to attempt to draw up a list, as it were, of the contradictions still in evidence between the legislative provisions at the international level in the area of protection and promotion of the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and the persistence in all areas of the world of incidents and governmental actions that are inconsistent with these provisions.",

This objective is also set forth in the Preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that \"... the advent of a world in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common people\". Article 2 of the Universal Declaration in its turn rejects any discrimination on the basis of religion when it stipulates that \"Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind ...\". The right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion is proclaimed in article 18 of the Universal Declaration, which qualifies it as follows: \"... this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.\"",

The Special Rapporteur considers that priority should be given to identifying the problems and stressing their extent and the seriousness of their implications. The highlighting of these problems in a way that takes into account the requirement for discretion and independence stipulated in Commission on Human Rights resolution 1986/20 may in itself help to initiate a process to enable intolerance and discrimination to be redressed.

For example, some laws penalize any attempt to change the secular nature of the State or recognize the right to disseminate anti-religious propaganda without tolerating the right to disseminate religious propaganda. Sometimes, one or several religions are recognized by legislation to the detriment of other denominations or beliefs; for example, in some countries, the law lists recognized denominations and places them under State control. Alternatively, it encourages monotheism to the detriment of other beliefs. In some cases, the Constitution determines the religious minorities to which legal status is granted, to the exclusion of others.

Some countries have undertaken campaigns for the forced assimilation of religious minorities, which may involve arbitrary changes to the names of places or of persons that have a particular religious connotation. In many cases, religious buildings or premises have been confiscated, converted to other uses or sometimes demolished under various pretexts, such as that of the need to rebuild certain districts. Sometimes, officials mandated by the Government carry out attacks against the houses of private individuals belonging to a religion or sect not recognized by the authorities. In some countries, confrontations occur between the forces of order and elements belonging to a given religion. In the same countries, the Government may impose restrictions on certain religious or cultural practices or attire closely associated with religious values. Sometimes, governmental restrictions apply to all religious practices; for example, in one country, the periods during which religious activities and ceremonies may be performed are established by decree; in several others, the State has at its disposal a series of institutional mechanisms enabling it to intervene in purely ecclesiastical questions. In others, on the other hand, one or several religions or particular sects are affected. For example, a sect or religion can be specifically forbidden by decree. In one country, declarations or memoranda from the highest State authorities proclaim the unlawful or punishable nature of a certain religion; in another, the decrees adopted by various ministries deny in practice any legal status or legal protection to the members of a religion that is not recognized officially. Another example is that of a country where the followers of a sect whose religious beliefs prohibit them from participating in any political activity are required, during checks carried out by the Government, to produce membership cards of the party in power.

Very often the media controlled or approved by the Government seeks, through hostile articles, to denounce, denigrate or ridicule religious values or to slander the spiritual leaders of a religious community. In one country, a press campaign orchestrated by the Government has been systematically conducted in order to discredit the religious authorities in the eyes of public opinion. In another, certain authors have been criticized in the pro-Government press for having advocated spiritual values in their writing. Sometimes, the authorities endeavour to promote an ideology or a particular religious movement to the detriment of the others, by extolling it in the Government-controlled press. For example, in one country, the study of the science of religion has been included in the school curriculum, in what has been viewed by the religious authorities as an attempt to make the rational prevail over the spiritual; in another the textbooks urge students to shun certain religious beliefs in favour of the general principles comprising the regime's official ideology. In one particular country, the State has encouraged the establishment of a church parallel to that already existing, granting it a relatively privileged status while retaining strict control over it. In another country, incitement by the Government to religious intolerance towards a given religion takes the form of sworn statements denouncing the followers of that religion which citizens have to sign in order to obtain a passport or administrative employment.",

In several countries, the members of outlawed communities suffer persecution and brutality on the part of their fellow citizens, without intervention on the part of the State. For example, in one country where the followers of a prohibited sect are subjected to serious persecution, no conviction has ever been handed down by a court for an offence perpetrated against a member of that sect.

For example, in one country, it would seem that the regime's anti-religious policy has had essentially nationalist objectives and has been undertaken mainly in order to eliminate the Greek Orthodox and Catholic religions considered to be divisive factors in a country with a Muslim majority. In another country, the fact that a person follows Islam is regarded by the authorities as an obstacle to loyalty towards the dominant party. Elsewhere, an ethnic minority criticizes the clergy for using its influence to exacerbate the rival majority ethnic group. In another country, once again with the stated purpose of securing the integration in the nation of \"foreign and isolated\" communities, certain animist religious traditions are being combated with a view to promoting the development of a monotheistic religion based on belief in one God. In another case, it seems that the followers of certain religions are persecuted not only because of the strength of their convictions, which in itself is in contradiction with the official ideology, but above all because they are identified with \"separatist\" elements.

A large number of incidents which have come to the attention of the Special Rapporteur, either through the media or in documents transmitted to him, involve clashes, sometimes violent, between members of various religious communities. For example, in a number of multiconfessional countries, the various religions do not always co-exist without incidents. For example, one country is afflicted by recurrent and serious riots stemming from incidents involving the followers of various faiths, such as throwing stones at religious processions, attacks against holy places or persons belonging to a rival community. Interconfessional violence in this country generally results in the loss of many lives. In another multiconfessional country, where civil war has been raging for over 10 years, reciprocal lack of understanding and religious hatred are added to other grounds for tension, thereby perpetuating a situation of conflict and unceasing violence. Other examples attest to the persistence, in the modern era, of age-old religious hatred.",

The freedom to train, appoint, elect or designate by succession appropriate leaders called for by the requirements and standards of any religion or belief (art. 6 (g)) also gives rise to specific restrictions. Thus, in one country, no priest has been ordained for 40 years. In several other countries, where the legal recognition of religious denomination is subject to approval by the State authorities, the freedom to train and designate spiritual leaders is often limited. For example, in one of these countries, clergymen must obtain a licence issued by the State to be able to officiate, and all promotions must be approved by the authorities. Only a few candidates are awarded these licences, which may be revoked at any time without justification. The restrictions on the training of religious leaders can lead to a serious shortage of clergymen. This sometimes brings about an increased dependence on the part of certain religious groups on \"lay brothers\" for taking charge of individual parishes. However, these \"lay brothers\" are not always officially recognized by the authorities, and as a result proceedings may be instituted for unlawful observances. ceremonies in accordance with the precepts of one's religion or belief (art. 6 (h)) is particularly significant since it allows the faithful to perform a series of ceremonies and religious customs that often have cultural and traditional connotations, it is precisely this cultural aspect that is often viewed with suspicion by the authorities and combated by them. Thus, in one country, the religious practice of the circumcision of male children is not permitted; similarly, obstacles are placed in the way of religious traditions such as the celebration of marriage and funeral ceremonies according to the rites of a religion. In another country, certain rites and ceremonies peculiar to tribal religions have been banned. Elsewhere, it is extremely difficult in practice for the followers of a certain religion to bury their dead in accordance with religious ritual. Sometimes a conflict of interest is visible between religious requirements and health requirements, particularly in the case of children. Thus, in one country, the courts decided in certain cases against ritual practices when the latter were believed to constitute a direct danger to children's lives. On occasion, the conflict arises from the fact that the authorities fail to take account, in certain areas, of religious requirements concerning days of rest. In one country, a petition was presented to the authorities to enable the members of a sect to be exempted from sitting for examinations on a certain week-day considered by their faith as a complete day of rest, to which the authorities agreed.",

Similarly, in the recent past several wars which resulted in heavy loss of life were fought partly on religious grounds. This is equally true of civil wars in which the members of several sects and religious denominations confront each other. Even in certain countries where there is no prevailing climate of civil war, confrontations between religious communities may lead to violence and cause the death of many persons.",

In some countries, there have been dozens, sometimes even hundreds of executions, including those of minors for religious reasons. The main charge is sometimes related to a religious matter, such as apostasy. In other cases, religious grounds are not expressly invoked, and political reasons or charges of espionage or sabotage are adduced.

Infringements of the right to liberty may take various forms, such as house arrest, internal exile, detention in a psychiatric hospital, imprisonment, sometimes for very long periods, and assignment to a re-education or labour camp. The legal justifications adduced by the authorities may also vary. In some cases, the law is invoked in cases of arrest of members of religious sects and various provisions concerning religious activities are applied, such as the illegality of certain sects or of certain religious demonstrations and practices; at other times, religious grounds are not explicitly cited among the charges brought, but religious demonstrations are interpreted in such a way as to make them comparable to offences or crimes punishable by law; there are also cases where religious leaders have been arrested without any charge being brought against them; sometimes, members of sects considered to be illegal are held without trial for periods of as long as five years.",

In some cases, believers are sent into internal exile, or placed under house arrest. In others, foreign missionaries have been forced to leave their country of residence because of the non-renewal of their residence permit.

At times these limitations apply to nearly all the members of one religion or religious community. Thus, in one country, not only do the authorities refuse to allow members of one religious minority to leave the country, but they have even arrested and brutally treated persons suspected of complicity with members of this minority who succeeded in emigrating. In another country, certain religious minorities, tens of thousands of whose members apply to emigrate, are usually denied their request.

In the same country, members of the clergy who have publicly criticized the role of the State in religious matters have been imprisoned or interned in psychiatric hospitals: in other cases, congregations have been slandered in the press without in their turn enjoying the right of reply. In another country, religious radio programmes and news concerning religion are censored; it is also forbidden to transmit certain religious ceremonies by television. Elsewhere, religious leaders have been imprisoned for expressing their opinion concerning the need for strict implementation of certain religious laws.
