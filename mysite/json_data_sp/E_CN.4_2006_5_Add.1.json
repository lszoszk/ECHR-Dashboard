Within 24 hours, he was taken out of Armenia against his will and transferred to a military unit across the border in Nagorno-Karabakh. He was beaten at a base in Martuni region of eastern Karabakh upon his refusal to swear the military oath and to sing the national anthem. He was later stripped and forced to stand in his underwear in front of about 1,800 soldiers and to tell them why he refused to do military service. He escaped from his unit and fled back to Armenia in August 2004. On 28 April 2005, he decided to give himself in and went with his lawyer to the police station in Yerevan. He was immediately arrested and taken to Stepanakert in Nagorno-Karabakh, where he was held in solitary confinement in an investigation cell at the time of the communication.",

As the deadline for re-registration expired during these deliberations, the authorities then suggested that the church disband and register anew at a different address, while the issue of adoption was \"practically resolved.\" - On 24 January 2005, the Belarusian Supreme Court upheld a 21 December 2004 ruling by the Minsk City Court, stating that the Minsk Society for Krishna Consciousness had rightly been refused re-registration under the 2002 law. Similar to the New Life Church mentioned above, the Minsk Krishna Consciousness Society did not have the State approval required by the 2002 religion law to use its own premises for worship, and was refused re-registration as a result. On 3 November 2004, the Minsk's Central District Court also issued an official warning after a police officer observed Krishna devotees praying at their temple without state permission. - Two other Krishna Consciousness communities in Bobruisk (Mogilev region) and Mogilev could not re-register and register respectively. The state authorities allegedly kept changing the reasons for not re-registering the Bobruisk group, first having claimed that the legal address was not in order, then the charter, and finally that the application was submitted too late. The authorities also insisted that the Mogilev group seeking initial registration must first pass an expert analysis and would not accept confirmation from the Minsk Society that it belonged to the same religious confession. The Bobruisk community could apply for registration as a new religious organization. Since the applicants had described themselves as \"Vaishnavis\" rather than Krishna devotees, the Mogilev group was reportedly deemed to be liable for expert analysis, although the 2002 religion law stipulates that this is the case only for religious confessions new to Belarus. These terms are allegedly synonymous. -The authorities in Brest had returned re-registration applications to six autonomous Baptist churches in the region. Moreover, the banks where two of the six had accounts closed these accounts at the request of the authorities. The six congregations had refused to accept a provision in the 2002 religion law stipulating that a religious organization may function only within the borders of the territory upon which it is registered. This was reportedly confirmed by Vasili Marchenko, the Brest regional religious affairs official. Maintaining that a similar restriction exists for all legal personalities in Belarus, Mr. Marchenko specified that the territory in question constituted the limits of a town or city if that was where an organization was registered or the several neighbouring small settlements or villages where founding members live.",

Furthermore, many of the provisions of the religious community's charter did not conform to current legislation; for this reason two of the organizers of the religious meetings held at the aforementioned address were fined under administrative law. With a view to resolving the issue, the organizer of the New Life Church was invited on two occasions to re-register the community using a new legal address.

The membership of this community includes none of the leaders or organizers of the previously registered religious community and its title and legal address have changed. These changes were not made in accordance with the correct procedure and re-registration was therefore denied for lack of legal continuity. The way out of the impasse was to wind up the former legal entity that had ceased its activities and register a new community under the proper procedure. The Mogilev Society for Krishna Consciousness was denied registration for procedural shortcomings during the application process. The Minsk Society for Krishna Consciousness was denied re-registration because the address it submitted as its legal address was a residential address, which is not allowed. The Minsk Society for Krishna Consciousness appealed the initial decision but the initial judgment of the authorities was upheld in appeal. Because this society continued to hold religious services nonetheless administrative proceedings were brought against them.",

In this regard, the Special Rapporteur wishes to emphasize that the right to freedom of religion is not limited to members of registered religious communities. As she noted in her previous report to the Commission on Human Rights, referring to the OSCE/ODIHR Guidelines for Review of Legislation pertaining to Religion or Belief, \"registration should not be compulsory, i.e. it should not be a precondition for practicing one's religion, but only for the acquisition of a legal personality and related benefits\" (E/CN.4/2005/61, para. 58).",

Belarus, CCPR/C/84/D/1207/2003) in which the Committee found a violation of Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, following the refusal to register Minsk Vaishnava community as a religious association. In its decision the Human Rights Committee made a distinction between the requirement for suitable premises for the purpose of carrying out religious rituals on the one hand and as a precondition for registration on the other hand (paragraphs 7.5 and 7.6). The Committee noted \"that the State party has not advanced any argument as to why it is necessary for the purposes of article 18, paragraph 3 [ICCPR], for a religious association, in order to be registered, to have an approved legal address which not only meets the standards required for the administrative seat of the association but also those necessary for premises used for purposes of religious ceremonies, rituals, and other group undertakings. Appropriate premises for such use could be obtained subsequent to registration. […] Also taking into account the consequences of refusal of registration, namely the impossibility of carrying out such activities as establishing educational institutions and inviting foreign religious dignitaries to visit the country, the Committee concludes that the refusal to register amounts to a limitation of the authors' right to manifest their religion under article 18, paragraph 1 that is disproportionate and so does not meet the requirements of article 18, paragraph 3. The authors' rights under article 18, paragraph 1 have therefore been violated\".",

        "Text": "83. The Special Rapporteur brought the following reports to t he attention of the Government: > Zeng Guangbo , 36 years old, a Chinese house church leader from Nanyang city, Henan province was arrested on 1 March 2004 for the second time that year while trying to pass the Inner-Mongolia border to Russia for a house church ministry there. According to an eyewitness, Zeng was taken away by Nanyang Public Security Bureau after he was detained at the border with Russia. > Pastor Cai Zhuohua, 32 years old, a house church leader ministering at six house churches in Beijing was allegedly arrested by three officers believed to be from the Department of State Security on 11 September 2004 after attending a Bible study session that morning. On 27 September Cai's wife, Xiao Yunfei, and her brother, Xiao Gaowen, and sister-in-law, Hu Jinyun, were also arrested in Hengshan county, Hunan province. All four arrested were reportedly being held at Qinghe Detention Center, Haidian District, Beijing. > On 6 August 2004, more than 100 house church leaders were allegedly arrested in Tongxu County, Kaifeng City, Henan Province. The group was beginning a two week retreat when more than 200 military police, Public Security Bureau and other officers surrounded the venue. No arrest warrants or official identification papers were shown during the arrest. Among those arrested were the leaders Zhang Wanshun of Sanmenxia City, Mr. Zhang Tianyun of Nanyang City and Mr. Yu Guoying of Tongxu County. The raided meeting of the 100 house church leaders was held at the home of Ms. Xiang Zi, the wife of one of the retreat organizers. She was arrested along with their three children, aged between eight and eleven years. The retreat was sponsored by the non-denominational house church network, Henan House Church. > On 6 August 2004, Liu Fenggang, Dr. Xu Yonghai and Zhang Shengqi were reportedly sentenced to terms of imprisonment of three years, two years and one year respectively by the Intermediate People's Court of Hangzhou City in Zhejiang Province. The three were convicted under Article 111 of the Chinese Criminal Law. The crime they were to have committed was \"illegally soliciting and providing national intelligence to overseas organizations\". They were alleged to have committed the crime by providing public court information about the trial of a house church Christian, Ms Li Baozhi, to an overseas magazine. > On 6 August 2004, eight underground Roman Catholic priests and two underground Roman Catholic seminarians were arrested in Sujiazhuang Village in Quyang County, Hebei Province, during a religious retreat. Nine of the ten arrested belonged to the Baoding Diocese. Amongst those detained were Huo Junlong, the administrator of the Baoding Diocese in Hebei, Zhang Zhenquian of Baoding and Huang of Sujiazhuang. On 12 July 2004, over a hundred leaders were reportedly arrested at a retreat in Xinjiang Autonomous Region. At the time of the communication, five of those arrested, namely Mr. Zhao Xinlan, 50, Ms. Li Cuiling, 44, Mr. Wang Chaoyi, 39, Mr. Yang Tian Lu, 39, and Ms. Gao Rui'er, 28, were still being detained in A Ke Su prefecture near the provincial capital of Urumqi. The retreat in Xinjiang was organised by the Anhui-based house church network, Ying Shang Church. One of the leaders of the group, businessman Luo Bing Yin, had been transferred from the local detention centre to Funan Prison in Anhui Province. It was reported that no court hearing had taken place and that charges against him were not known. On 6 August 2004, , without obtaining the relevant permit, Zeng and some 70 other persons held an unlawful gathering in Muxianzhang village, Lizhuang township, Tongxu county, Henan province, which seriously disrupted public order in that area. That same day, the Henan province public security authorities, acting in accordance with the Rules on Administrative Penalties of the People's Republic of China imposed administrative penalties and delivered an educational reprimand against the persons involved. None of these persons was taken into custody, however. Since 2003, Cai, together with his associates Xiao Yunfei and the three other persons, without obtaining industrial, commercial or tax registration, have unlawfully printed and sold some 1 million publications, swiftly amassing immense profits totaling some 500,000 yuan and, in view of the large quantity of publications, have breached article 225 of the Chinese Criminal Code, on unlawful business operations. On 27 September 2004, the Beijing city public security authorities, acting in accordance with the Chinese Criminal Code and the Chinese Code of Criminal Procedure, took Cai and the four other persons into criminal custody; on 20 October 2004, following approval by the procurator's office, they were arrested. Procedural investigations are currently being conducted. In early October 2001, Liu and Xu conspired together and, with funds provided by Xu, Liu moved to Anshan city in Liaoning province for the purpose of gathering State intelligence. After this, Liu set out the intelligence which he had gathered in documentary form and with Xu's assistance, transmitted it abroad. On 25 July 2003, Liu received instructions from persons outside the country that he was to proceed to Dongtou county in Wenzhou city, Zhejiang province, and to Xiaoshan district, Xihu district and other districts of Hangzhou city to gather State intelligence. After this, Liu set out the intelligence which he had gathered in documentary form and on 5 August of that same year instructed Zhang to transmit the materials by email to persons outside the country. On 17 August 2003, in Dachengzi township, in the Miyun district of Beijing, he was taken in and questioned by the police for participating in an unlawful activity. On that same day, Liu gathered together relevant information about the event and set it out in documentary form and, with Zhang's help, transmitted it by email to persons outside the country. Following appraisal by the State secrets office, the materials referred to above were deemed to be State intelligence. The Hangzhou city people's intermediate court determined that the conduct of the three persons in question constituted the offence of espionage for a foreign power and the divulging of State intelligence and, on 6 August 2004, passed verdict at first instance, sentencing Liu to three years' fixed term imprisonment and stripping him of his political rights for three years; sentencing Xu to two years' fixed term imprisonment and stripping him of his political rights for two years; and sentencing Zhang to one years' fixed term imprisonment and stripping him of his political rights for one year. After judgement was passed, Liu and Xu both filed appeals. Zhang accepted the judgement and did not file an appeal. He was released on 7 February 2005 on completion of his sentence. After hearing the case at second instance, the Zhejiang high court found that the original judgement had been based on clear facts, the legal provisions applied were correct, the sentence was commensurate with the offence and the trial proceedings had been in accordance with due process and, on 13 September 2004, the court ruled that the appeal brought by Liu and Xu should be dismissed and that the original judgement should stand. On 6 August 2004, Huo held a training session for underground priests in Quyang county and, after he and the others had been duly admonished by officials of the religious affairs bureau, they were ordered to disperse voluntarily. The public security authorities did not intervene in this matter, nor were any restrictive measures taken against him. Since 2003, without obtaining industrial, commercial or tax registration, Luo has unlawfully printed some 20,000 copies of publications, reproduced many thousands of leaflets and marketed these among the general public, swiftly amassing immense profits. In view of the large quantities involved, he breached the provisions of article 225 of the Chinese Criminal Code, on unlawful business operations. On 2 September 2004, the Fuyang city public security authorities, acting in accordance with the Chinese Criminal Code and the Chinese Code of Criminal Procedure, took Luo into criminal detention; on 1 October, following approval by the procurator's office, Luo was arrested; on 29 November the case was referred to the prosecution service for the institution of legal proceedings. According to our understanding, the Xinjiang public security authorities have not taken any restrictive measures against Zhao Xinliang and the five other persons. The action taken by the public security authorities in adopting mandatory measures against the above -mentioned persons was fully consistent with their status as offenders against Chinese law and had nothing to do with issues relating to the freedom of expression or opinion or the freedom of religious belief. Throughout the entire course of the legal proceedings referred to above, the Chinese judicial authorities acted in strict compliance with the legal stipulations of the Chinese Criminal Code, the Chinese Code of Criminal Procedure, Regulations on Penalties for Offences against the Administration of Law and Order and other instruments.",

She went on hunger strike for 64 days, during which time she was subjected to torture and harsh labour for fifteen hours daily.

In paragraph 44, the Committee stated that, \"[w]hile noting the adoption of the Regional Ethnic Autonomy Act in 2001, which guarantees freedom of religion for ethnic minorities in mainland China, [it] is concerned about reports that children, in particular Tibetan Buddhist, Uighur and Hui children, have been restricted in studying and practising their religion, and in some cases have been detained for participating in religious activities. It is also concerned at reports that children of families practising their religion, notably the Falun Gong, are subject to harassment, threats and other negative actions, including re-education through labour. The Committee notes the information provided about the Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, but remains concerned that it has not yet been possible to have this information confirmed by an independent expert.\" In relation to this observation the Committee in paragraph 45 recommends that \"the State party take all necessary measures to ensure the full implementation of the Regional Ethnic Autonomy Act. In particular, the Committee recommends that the State party: > (a) Enact legislation explicitly guaranteeing freedom of religion for those under 18 that is not tied to a limited number of recognized faiths, and which respects the rights and duties of parents to give guidance to their children in the exercise of their rights in this rega rd in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child; > (b)Repeal any ban instituted by local authorities on children of any age from participating in Tibetan religious festivals or receiving religious education; (c)Repeal any ban instituted by local authorities on children of any age from attending mosques or receiving religious education throughout the mainland; > (d) Take all necessary measures to ensure that children may choose whether to participate in classes on religion or atheism; (e) Allow an independent expert to visit and confirm the well-being of Gedhun Choekyi Nyima while respecting his right to privacy, and that of his parents.\"",

The freedom of speech must be exercised with the necessary respect for other human rights, including the right to protection against discrimination, insult and degradation. In finding that there was no reasonable suspicion that a criminal offence indictable by the state had been committed, the Prosecutor attached importance to the fact that the article in question concerns a matter of public interest, which means that there is an extended access to make statements without these statements constituting a criminal offence.

Furthermore the Danish Government is continuing its dialogue with representatives of minorities and leaders of religious communities in order to achieve mutual respect and understanding as well as stronger community participation, active citizenship, freedom and equality, better opportunities for the young and prevention of radicalization.",

The Special Rapporteur is grateful for the Government's response and encourages the Government to continue its efforts to increase mutual understanding and religious tolerance, in accordance with article 10 of Resolution 2005/40 of the Commission on Human Rights. She would like to reiterate the words from her joint press statement with the Special Rapporteur for contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and the Special Rapporteur for the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression on 8 February 2006. In this statement the Special Rapporteurs expressed their concern at E/CN.4/2006/5/Add.1 Page 30 the grave offence caused by the cartoons and at the violent response the cartoons had provoked and they made a special call for tolerance and dialogue. The Special Rapporteurs acknowledged that while both freedom of religion and freedom of expression should be equally respected, the exercise of the right to freedom of expression carries with it special duties and responsibilities. It requires good judgment, tolerance and a sense of responsibility. Furthermore the Special Rapporteurs feel that peaceful expression of opinions and ideas, either orally, through the press or other media, should always be tolerated. The press must enjoy large editorial freedom to promote a free flow of news and information, within and across national borders, thus providing an arena for debate and dialogue. Nevertheless, the use of stereotypes and labeling that insult deep-rooted religious feelings do not contribute to the creation of an environment conducive to constructive and peaceful dialogue among different communities.",

At the time of the communication, no approval had been issued.

Subsequently police ordered to halt construction. In 1999, following a request by the villages' Copts, Ministry of Interior officials conducted an inspection.

It was reported that Mr. Alexandridis has performed military service in Russia prior to moving to Greece and becoming a conscientious objector. He applied for conscientious objector status, but the Greek Law 2510/1997 excludes anyone who has previously served in any armed forces from the right to conscientious objection. > On 17 May 2005, Andreas Anastasiou, a Jehovah's Witness, was reportedly sentenced by the Military Court in Larissa to six months of imprisonment, for refusing reserve duty. He had already served his military service in the Greek army prior to becoming a Jehovah's Witness. > On 18 May 2005, Nikos Baltoukas , aged 37, was sentenced by the Military Court of Xanthi to 15 months of imprisonment on charges of insubordination for refusing to perform one week of military reserve duty.

Reports indicate that Mr. Koutsomanolakis was already charged with insubordination in 1979, at a time when there was no alternative service in Greece, because as a Jehovah's Witness he refused to serve military service on religious grounds.

The following information was provided by the Government regarding the handling of these cases by the competent military courts according the legislation in force: Alexandridis Makedonas, 38 years old, was sentenced on 10 May 2005 by the 5-member Military Court of Ionnina (Judgement no 68/2005), with four to one (4-1) votes, to six(6) months in prison and to the legal cost (73 Euro), for \"Disobedience in times of peace\", because, when he was drafted into the Armed Forces (Health Operation Centre-Health Training Centre) on 31 January 2005, he refused to receive clothing and equipment and attend the military training. Instead, he stated that he wished, as a Jehovah's Witness, to serve in \"a social political alternative service\". The execution of this sentence was suspended for three years and, in the event of lifting or revocation of the suspension, the commutation of the sentence to a fine of 4.40 Euro for each day of imprisonment was ordered. The proceedings revealed that Mr. Alexandridis has carried out 24 months of military service in the Armed Forces of the former Soviet Union and was aware that, in Greece, he was obliged to carry out three-months of military service (presidential decree 292/03). He did not meet the legal requirements because he did not act within the relevant time limit (from the date of notice until enlistment) although he had been examined twice in the past by the competent exemption committee and he had received two annual deferrals (27 March 2002 and 19 August 2003). An appeal was lodged against the above judgement. A cassation appeal may be lodged against the judgement of the military court of appeal before the Supreme Court. Andreas Anastasiou, 30 years old, was sentenced on 17 May 2005 by the 5-member Court Martial of Larissa (Judgement no 89/2005), with three to two (3-2) votes, to a total of six (6) months in prison and to the legal costs (E73), for \"Disobedience in times of peace\", and \"draft evasion in times of peace\", because, on 28 March 2005, he refused to receive clothing and equipment and attend the military training of his unit (32TYP), invoking his religious beliefs as a Jehovah's Witness and, on 13 September 2003, he did not report to the military camp of 30 MKD to carry out a reserve obligation of nine (9) days, although he was called by special personal notice, again invoking his religious beliefs as a Jehovah's Witness. Therefore, he became a draft evader from 14 September to 10 January 2005. This sentence was commuted by the court to a fine of 4.40Euros for each day of imprisonment and its execution was suspended for three years. The proceedings revealed that Mr. Anastasiou has carried out armed military service in the Greek Armed Forces in the past. An appeal was lodged against the above judgment. A cassation appeal may be lodged against the above judgment of the military court of appeal before the Supreme Court. Nikos Baltoukas, 37 years old, was sentenced on 18 May 2005 by the 5-member Court Martial of Xanthi (Judgment No 271/2005) to fifteen months in prison for \"Disobedience in times of peace\" because he did not enlist, although he was called by special personal notice to enlist on 31 October 2004 to the 25th Engineering Company (LMX) to carry out a reserve obligation. Therefore, he became a draft evader from 1 November 2004 to 4 February 2005. Mr. Baltoukas did not invoke any religious reasons for his refusal. The execution of this sentence was suspendedfor three years and its commutation to a fine of 4.40 Euro for each day of imprisonment was ordered. The aforesaid judgment establishes that, in his defence, Mr. Baltoukas stated, inter alia: \"... the Greek army has changed radically as to the purpose which it serves. It serves economic interests and, for this reason, they are often beyond the borders. The most important reason for my refusal to carry out the reserve obligation is my class. I am a construction worker and I live with the anxiety of day labour. Therefore I am in no position to leave my work each time the army may call me, until I become 45 years old. I defend my country in my own way, and, if I have to.... I will enlist in the extraordinary event that Greece is in danger. I found myself in a situation of conflict of duties ... Politics change; it was different in 1980 and different in 1990. In any event, when I served my regular service, things were more clear\". An appeal was lodge d against the above judgment. A cassation appeal may be lodged against the judgment of the military court of appeal before the Supreme Court. Georgios Koutsomanolakis, 45 years old, was unanimously sentenced on 23 May by the 5-member Court Martial of Athens (Judgment no 645/2205) to two (2) years in prison for \"Disobedience in times of peace\" because he did not enlist, although he was called to enlist on 6 August 1979 in the Greek Armed Forces (44TH Infantry). Therefore, he became a draft evader from 7 August 1979 to 1 January 2005, when his draft evasion was discontinued by law, having attained his 45th year of age. He invoked his religious beliefs as a Jehovah's Witness for the nonenlistment. The above sentenced was commuted by the court to a fine of 4.40 Euro for each day of imprisonment and its execution was suspended for three years. A thirteen-day period of detention was deducted from the two-year sentence, during which Mr. Koutsomanolakis was detained in Korydallos prison awaiting trial. An appeal was lodged against the above judgment. A cassation appeal may be lodged against the judgment of the military court of appeal before the Supreme Court.",

The pending amendments foresaw imprisonment for up to four years and a tenfold increase in the amount of the fine. Moreover, the pending amendments required a person who wishes to convert to inform the local authorities 30 days in advance.",

They claimed that Mr. Al-Harbi had mocked Islam and had attempted to sow doubt in the students' creed by sharing his opinion with them on various topics including Christianity, Judaism and the causes of terrorism. He had moreover encouraged his students to engage in critical thinking in resolving apparent differences of meaning between the Koran and the words and deeds of the prophet Muhammad. Mr. Al-Harbi was not allowed to attend the trial against him and his lawyer was not recognised by the Court. Mr. Al-Harbi is appealing the decision.",

Later, he was ordered to enter a darkened \"Common Cell No. 1\" where the inmates threatened him with death for being a traitor and beat him and pulled his hair. He was later transferred to a single cell, where he continued to be subject to threats, beatings, and demands for money and clothes from fellow prisoners. He sustained injuries to his lips, bruises to his chin, neck, body, knee, legs and feet. As a result of his injuries he has experienced breathing pains, hair loss, and difficulty standing. Despite informing the prison staff, they did not prevent further attacks, but rather encouraged other prisoners to beat him.

Atamurat Suvkhanov was sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment in the north-eastern town of Dashoguz on 17 December 2004, while Begench Shakhmuradov was reportedly sentenced in the Azatlyk district of the capital Ashgabad to one year's imprisonment on 10 February 2005. It was reported that Mr. Suvkhanov was held in the women's labour camp in the eastern town of Seydi whereas the whereabouts of Mr. Shakhmuradov were unknown. Both men were sentenced under Article 219 of the Criminal Code, which punishes refusal to serve in the armed forces. This brings the total number of known religious prisoners of conscience in the State to five, four of them Jehovah's Witnesses and one Muslim, the 57-year-old former chief mufti, Nasrullah ibn Ibadullah , who was arrested after falling out with President Niyazov and was serving a 22-year sentence on charges that the Government allegedly refused to make public. He had not been freed despite recent reported prisoner amnesties. The two other Jehovah's Witness prisoners, Mansur Masharipov and Vepa Tuvakov, both from Dashoguz, were reportedly sentenced on 28 May and 3 June 2004 on the same grounds and were reportedly held in the Seydi men's labour camp. All these sentences were reportedly issued following the televised announcement by President Saparmurat Niyazov in early 2004 that all imprisoned conscientious objectors should be released. Reports indicated that religious prisoners of c onscience in Turkmenistan had been harshly treated in the past, regularly beaten, threatened with homosexual rape, and in one case allegedly treated with psychotropic drugs. Concerns had been expressed that Turkmenistan offers no non-combat alternative to those who cannot serve in the military on grounds of conscience.",

The Special Rapporteur was further informed that the Protestant Peace Church, in the town of Chirchik, outside the capital Tashkent, and the capital's Jehovah's Witness congregation were the latest religious communities to be refused registration by the Government. Both communities would now be at risk of prosecution and therefore the possibility of being imposed large fines and jail terms. The reasons given to the Peace Church for the decision on 7 January 2005 reportedly included the claim that their application contained \"many grammatical and spelling mistakes.\" In fact, it was reported that none of the reasons given were specified by Uzbekistan's religion law. Reports indicate that the Tashkent community of the Jehovah's Witnesses had long been denied registration, despite renewed attempts to register since March 2004. Refusal to register a religious community has serious implications. Indeed, the country's law on religions makes the activities of an unregistered religious community subject to prosecution, both as administrative and criminal offences. Reports indicate that, in 2004, only one new non-Muslim religious community was registered by the State.",
