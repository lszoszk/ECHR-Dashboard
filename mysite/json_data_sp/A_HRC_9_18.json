Experience has shown that current Division of Conference Management document-processing capacity cannot meet the documentation requirements of the Human Rights Council and its subsidiary machinery. The lack of sufficient permanent conference capacity does not allow for the required flexibility and timeliness in accommodating urgent and unforeseen requests for meetings and processing of documentation. Additional staff resources, provisionally estimated at approximately US\\$ 7,500,000 per year, are accordingly urgently required to enable the Division to ensure the appropriate level of support required by the Human Rights Council.",

To increase public awareness and understanding of its work, the provision of an adequate level of resources for information work is indispensable. Webcasting has been identified by the Council as a vital component in communication about its role and functioning. Effective and continuous delivery of webcasting and all media services require stable, permanent personnel and facilities. In order to provide these services, the Department of Public Information will require additional infrastructure of approximately US\\$ 2,500,000, supplemented by related staff and other recurring costs of approximately US\\$ 1,700,000.",

Netherlands, the Philippines, Poland, South Africa, Tunisia and the United Kingdom. The details of the review of these States are as follows: The 47 pre-session documents submitted comprised three sets: - First set: 15 national reports (South Africa eventually decided not to submit a national report, amounting to a total of 534 estimated standard pages (ESP, comprising 330 words) with an average of 35.6 ESP per report versus the 20 page maximum as stated in Resolution 5/1, which thus should have amounted to 300 ESP. DCM processed 234 additional estimated standard pages. - Second set: 16 compilations of information by the substantive secretariat, amounting to a total of 355 ESP with an average of 22.18 ESP per report versus the 10 page maximum as stated in Resolution 5/1, which should have amounted to 160 ESP. DCM processed 195 additional estimated standard pages. - Third set: 16 summaries of information provided by relevant stakeholders, amounting to a total of 325 ESP with an average of 20.31 ESP per report versus the 10 page maximum as stated in Resolution 5/1, which should have amounted to 160 ESP. DCM processed 165 additional estimated standard pages. 6 This paper emphasizes the different kinds of documentation (pre-, in- and post-session) because different deadlines apply to them. Repeated General Assembly resolutions stipulate that, except in special cases, pre-session documents should be submitted for processing and translation no later than ten weeks before the beginning of the session at which they are to be discussed, and made available to delegations in all relevant languages six weeks before the opening of the session. In-session documentation is supposed to be translated within 48 hours of submission (24 hours at Headquarters, which operates night and weekend shifts for the purpose). Post-session documentation is not normally subject to such rigorous time limits except where the outcome of one meeting (generally of a subsidiary body) is treated as input for another; in that case, the 10/6-week rule applies. | To summarize: The actual submission was | 1,214 ESP | | |------------------------------------------|-----------|--| | The original submission should have been | 620 ESP | | | Pages exceeding the mandate | 594 ESP | | In addition to the above, three corrigenda representing 4 ESP were submitted. 16 outcome reports were presented at the end of the working group session and treated as post-session documents, amounting to a total of 419 estimated standard pages with an average of 26.18 ESP per report. No page limitation was mentioned in Resolution 5/1.
