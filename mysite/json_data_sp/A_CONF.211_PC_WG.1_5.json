The independent expert believes that efforts to reduce poverty are essential to larger efforts to promote the full range of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights for minority communities. Development programmes, policies and activities need to take fully into account the needs and rights of minorities. She emphasizes that in developing such programmes and policies it is important to consider disaggregated data, and especially statistical information on poverty, income and economic participation. The analysis of such data can reveal inequalities between communities and allow for policy decisions and programmes that address those Paragraphs 2 and 69, Durban Declaration; paragraphs 49 and 172, Programme of Action. inequalities. The independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty is of the view that the devastating effects of the combination of extreme poverty and racial discrimination are frequently hidden due to poor data collection on the situation of marginalized populations. She fully endorses the recommendation of the independent expert on minority issues in this regard.",

In relation to the discriminatory denial and deprivation of citizenship, the independent expert on minority issues considers that States and the international community must expressly acknowledge the problem and work towards solutions.

She refers the Preparatory Committee to a series of recommendations that she made on this issue and expresses her hope that States will use the recommendations as a tool for developing concrete policies and measures to deal with citizenship issues in a non-discriminatory manner within the framework of international law.",

In light of the overlap between poverty and racism, the independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty emphasizes that measures taken to combat and eliminate poverty and racism must be mutually reinforcing and complementary. There is the need to strengthen coordination among initiatives to eliminate poverty and racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance. Within the framework of a human rights-based approach to designing policies to eliminate poverty, the independent expert notes that the right to non-discrimination is crucial. She calls for the establishment of effective mechanisms to promote the participation of people living in extreme poverty, in particular those that are victims of various forms of discrimination, in the design, implementation and evaluation of policies affecting them.",
