    "Text": "83. The main conclusion of the present report is that the most fundamental principle of human rights – that all persons have an equal right to enjoy all human rights – has been endangered by an extensive pattern of unlawful, discriminatory and disproportionate restrictions and repression of freedom of expression, primarily of Palestinian activists and their supporters in Western Europe and North America. This trend did not emerge with the Israeli assault on Gaza but has become more widespread in the past year, from the targeted killing of journalists in Gaza to the banning of Palestinian protests, speech and symbols in various countries, especially in North America and Europe."

Such repression is particularly disturbing in the light of the recent advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice, which reaffirms the right to selfdetermination of Palestinians and finds that the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory is unlawful, with an obligation placed on all other States to ensure that \"impediments\" to end it are removed. In the opinion, the Court vindicates the Opinion of Geoffrey Robertson KC, \"Antisemitism, the IHRA definition and its consequences for freedom of expression\", para. 2. Available at https://prc.org.uk/upload/library/files/Anti-Semitism\\\\Opinion\\\\03.09.18eds.pdf. See National Writers Union, \"Red Lines: Retaliation in the media history during the war on Gaza\", 6 May 2024. Submission of Jøder for Retfærdig Fred (af 5784). Meta has revised its policy to restrict speech only where the term \"Zionist\" is deemed to be a proxy for Jewish people. See Meta Transparency Center, \"Update from the Policy Forum on our approach to 'Zionist' as a proxy for hate speech\", 9 July 2024. Civil society organizations, like Access Now, are concerned whether Meta will be able to enforce a nuanced policy given its automated decision-making tools and previous history of overenforcement of Palestinian content. legitimacy of Palestinian advocacy for human rights, including the right to selfdetermination, and creates an imperative for all States to change their laws, policies and practices restricting or prohibiting such advocacy."

In recent years, many western Governments have taken a restrictive approach to public protests, viewing them through the lens of security, law enforcement, countering terrorism and violent extremism, that is not in line with human rights standards. Blanket prohibition of Palestinian protests, slogans or symbols is inherently incompatible with international human rights law. Any restriction of freedom of expression must respect scrupulously the requirements of legality, legitimate aims and the necessity and proportionality of measures to achieve those aims, as set out in international law."
