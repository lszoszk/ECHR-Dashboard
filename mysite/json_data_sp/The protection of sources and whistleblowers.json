In some situations, formal oversight mechanisms and access to information laws compel disclosure. Even where they do exist, however, they are not always effective. Other approaches may be needed, for as a general rule, secrets do not out themselves. Rather, disclosure typically requires three basic elements: a person with knowledge who is willing and able to shed light on what is hidden; a communicator or a communication platform to disseminate that information; and a legal system and political culture that effectively protect both. Without that combination — source, dissemination and protection — what is secret all too often remains hidden, and the more that remains hidden, the less authorities are held accountable and individuals are able to make informed decisions about matters that may most affect them and their communities.",

Those are the principal rationales for legal and political frameworks that promote and guarantee access to information and protect the individuals and organizations that often make such access possible. Notwithstanding formal progress, Governments, international organizations and private entities often target persons disclosing secret information, in particular when they bring to light uncomfortable truths or allegations. Those who wish to call attention to malfeasance may find internal channels blocked, oversight bodies ineffective and legal protection unavailable. The absence of recourse often forces whistle-blowers to become sources for public disclosure, which may make them vulnerable to attack. International, regional and national trends toward greater formal protection do not necessarily translate into effective protection for sources a nd whistle-blowers. Ineffective protection results from gaps in law; a preference for secrecy over public participation; technology that makes it easy for institutions to breach privacy and anonymity; overly broad application of otherwise legitimate restrictions; and suspicion or hostility towards sources, whistle-blowers and the reporters who make such information known.",

The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights enshrines the same rights in its article 19, which emphasizes that the freedom applies to information and ideas of all kinds. Sources and whistle-blowers enjoy the right to impart information, but their legal protection when publicly disclosing information rests especially on the public's right to receive it. That right has been emphasized by previous special rapporteurs and experts in the European, African and inter-American systems. As indicated in general comment No. 34 of the Human Rights Committee on article 19: Freedoms of opinion and expression, it extends to information held by all public bodies, whether legislative, executive or judicial, and it applies to other entities when they are carrying out public functions (paras. 7 and 18.) The right to receive information advances several principles that underlie and animate human rights. It advances the individual's ability to seek out information of all kinds, allowing the development of opinions protected against interference under article 19 (1) of the Covenant. It encourages participation in public affairs, which is independently protected by article 25 of the Covenant. It encourages accountability, increasing the costs for those who might engage in wrongdoing.",

Secrecy should be imposed only on information that would, if disclosed, harm a specified interest under article 19 (3); even in the event of a risk of harm, a process should be in place to determine whether the public interest in disclosure outweighs that risk. Processes that allow for evaluation of classification decisions, within institutions and by the public, including penalties for over-classification, should be considered and adopted in order to ensure the greatest possible access to information in the public interest. Th e Swedish Constitution and its Freedom of the Press Act provide perhaps a welcomed translation of the principle of maximum disclosure when it comes to access to information held by public bodies, protecting the right of all public officials to communicate information and, except for specified situations, prohibiting public officials from sanctioning others for communicating information outside their institutions.",

It is common for such people to adopt and publish methodologies that underscore the degree of professionalism upon which their work depends. Many non-governmental organizations are themselves publishers of wellsourced content that, in form and substance, is virtually identical to the work of the press, often the result of thorough research, in-the-field reporting and analysis. It is common for human rights researchers to rely upon sources who require confidentiality for safety. Recognizing a broad scope of protection, the European Court of Human Rights indicated that \"non-governmental organisations, like the press, may be characterised as social 'watchdogs.' In that connection their activities warrant similar Convention protection to that afforded to the press\". The Information Commissioner's Office in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland granted a non-governmental organization, Global Witness, an exemption from the national Data Protection Act because its work, and those of other non-media organizations, \"constitutes a journalistic purpose even if they are not professional journalists and the publication forms part of a wider campaign to promote a particular cause\".

They often lack strong measures of confidentiality and independence from the organization in which they are embedded, putting whistle blowers at risk of retaliation. Many mechanisms are widely perceived as ineffective, so that the risk of retaliation may appear too great in the face of low odds of success. For those reasons, among others, studies suggest that employees have relatively low confidence in whistle-blowing mechanisms. If States aim to have working whistle-blowing procedures that reduce public disclosure, they must ensure the effectiveness and trust in the full independence of whistle-blowing processes.",

However, anonymous reporting provides a safeguard for those situations where the potential whistle-blower lacks confidence in the ability of existing legal mechanisms to provide protections against retaliation and yet wishes not to make a public disclosure.

Institutions that operate in national security, such as institutions of defence, diplomacy, internal security and law enforcement, and intelligence, may have a greater claim not to disclose information than other public bodies, but they have no greater claim to hide instances of wrongdoing or other information where the value of disclosure outweighs the harm to the institution. Yet whistle-blower protections are often weak, or simply unavailable, in the area of national security and intelligence. Those who disclose wrongdoing in national security institutions are often subject to retaliation, such as job loss or transfer, denial or revocation of security clearance, and investigation, prosecution and harsh sentencing, and they lack redress because of legal doctrines that support an infrastructure of secrecy.
