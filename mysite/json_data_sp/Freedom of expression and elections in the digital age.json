In 2024, more than half of the world's voting age population, living in over 50 countries ranging from liberal democracies to electoral autocracies, went to the polls to choose their national, regional and local leaders. According to a survey conducted in 2023 in 19 countries with varied political systems, just over half of respondents believed that elections in their country had been free and fair. A related survey found that freedom of expression and electoral integrity were two of the top elements that were in global decline.",

It empowers citizens to obtain information on the electoral process and to debate, discuss and make informed decisions on their choice of representatives. It allows candidates and political parties to campaign on the issues at stake in the elections. It enables the media and civil society to inform the public, scrutinize candidates and their party platforms and report on the integrity of the electoral process.

During elections in 2024, many electoral management bodies worldwide reported positive partnerships with major platforms. There were also reports of stonewalling by platforms, however, when electoral bodies sought records relating to risk assessments and the application of election policies, even when requests were made under access-to-information laws. Google, X and Meta reportedly resisted such data requests from the Electoral Commission of South Africa.116",

From that situation, the Special Rapporteur draws seven key conclusions: (a) Firstly, elections are information crisis points in which access to accurate and timely information is vital but also highly vulnerable to attack, censorship and distortion. It is imperative that States, companies and civil society work together to protect freedom of expression and close the trust deficit on electoral integrity;; (b) Secondly, politicians and public officials play a central role in shaping public debate and opinion. They bear a significant responsibility for the degradation of the information environment. They should not abuse their privileged position to undermine electoral integrity, incite violence, hostility and discrimination or attack the media and civil society. Instead, through ethical behaviour, they should enhance the quality of political discourse and build public trust in elections;; (c) Thirdly, the backsliding of social media platforms on commitments to human rights and electoral integrity rings an alarm bell that States and the international community ignore at their peril. As the principal vector of information in; See Sandra Gonzalez-Bailón and David Lazer, \"The need to make content moderation transparent\", Tech Policy Press, 11 December 2024.

See Daniela Alvarado Rincón and Ognjan Denkovski, \"Why we're suing Elon Musk's X for German election data\", EUobserver, 27 February 2025. the digital age, the platforms serve a public good and should not deprioritize human safety and human rights for political and commercial interests. As global companies with universal human rights responsibilities, platforms should ensure that their policies and programmes are globally consistent, fair and aligned with their international obligations; (d) Fourthly, the decline of media freedom, independence, diversity and pluralism deserves urgent action. Democracy needs a healthy legacy media alongside a trustworthy online environment to ensure a diverse and vibrant electoral information system;; (e) Fifthly, undermining freedom of expression in the name of fighting disinformation is short-sighted and counterproductive. Freedom of expression is vital to healthy democratic discourse. That does not mean that disinformation cannot be restricted lawfully but that such restrictions must scrupulously respect the principles of legality, necessity, proportionality and legitimate objectives, as set out in article 19 (3) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;; (f) Sixthly, the advocacy of hatred and incitement to violence that masquerades as political speech has no protection under international law. Powerful public figures must not be permitted to instrumentalize the virality of platforms to incite violence or silence critical voices with threats of violence;; (g) Finally, experience has shown that multifaceted, multi-stakeholder strategies grounded in human rights and combining a range of legal and non-legal measures are the most effective way to fight disinformation and other forms of information manipulation.",
