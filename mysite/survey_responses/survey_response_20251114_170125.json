    "q5": "I think I found it confusing from the beginning until the end. Even though I understand the concept of using LLM's and human language to give prompts so it can help you programme. I felt overwhelmed by all the applications (Cursor, JSON, Google Colab, LM Arena, Python) and use of other terms which to me I could not really distinguish between so I struggled to keep up with the programming itself. I was overwhelmed switching between all the apps and couldn't quite understand what each one was for in a short space of time.\n\nI also did not quite understand the purpose of the database from the beginning. i.e. what is the point of doing all this programming to create a search engine which can be done in more simple ways i.e. control+F? I am sure there is a good answer, but I think maybe if the purpose and goal could have been described more clearly at the beginning it would have helped me get started.",

    "q10": "It was really good to see how AI is practiced in reality. AI and New Technology is a big and complex field, and I enjoyed the practical element - it put a face to the name in a way! Even though I haven't come out with skills I can do in my own time, it has definitely planted a seed to the potential ways I could teach myself in the future with more time.",

    "q13": "Clearer introduction. Slower, step-by-step procedures, checking in on everyone that they have completed a step, before people continue on their own with more confidence",
