The same considerations amount in any event to grounds for finding that respect for human rights (as defined in the Convention) requires an examination of the complaint on the merits (see Friedrich and Others v. Poland, nos. 25344/20 and 17 others, § 125, 20 June 2024, and the case-law cited therein).", "para_idx": 80}, {"section": "merits", "text": "28.  Accordingly, the Court dismisses the Government’s objection.", "para_idx": 81}, {"section": "merits", "text": "29.  The Government raised several other preliminary objections to the admissibility of the application as a whole, that is without expressly specifying the Convention provisions to which those arguments applied.

The Government argued that Article 6 was not applicable: (i) under its civil limb, in so far as the applicant’s suspension was concerned, and (ii) under its criminal limb, as regards the lifting of the applicant’s immunity. Concerning the civil limb, the Government asserted that the applicant participated in the exercise of public power or there existed a “special bond of trust and loyalty” between her, as a judge, and the State, as employer. Therefore, the dispute in the applicant’s case was not an example of an “ordinary labour dispute” relating to “salaries, allowances or similar entitlements” to which Article 6 should in principle apply. Polish law did not grant judges the right to exercise their authority and remain in office irrespective of their conduct; nor did it grant them the right to be released from criminal responsibility. As for the criminal limb, the Government submitted that proceedings in which a court decided whether to permit a judge to be held criminally liable were neither criminal nor even disciplinary. They were of an ancillary nature and were conducted separately from the criminal proceedings at their in rem stage. The subject of those proceedings was solely the question whether the immunity of a judge should be lifted, and their aim was limited to allowing a prosecutor in charge to conduct criminal proceedings in order to establish whether the offence in question had been committed.

Regarding the criminal head of that provision, it was applicable to her case because proceedings on the lifting of immunity of a judge were by their nature related to repression. In those proceedings a competent court could decide not only to lift an obstacle to pursuing a criminal case, but also to apply directly repressive measures, such as suspension from judicial duties paired with a salary reduction (both of which had been applied in her case) and detention.", "para_idx": 95}, {"section": "merits", "text": "(b)   The Court’s assessment", "para_idx": 96}, {"section": "merits", "text": "(i)      Applicability of Article 6 § 1 under its civil limb in so far as the suspension of the applicant from her judicial duties is concerned", "para_idx": 97}, {"section": "merits", "text": "39.  The general principles regarding the applicability of Article 6 § 1 in its “civil” limb were recently summarised in Grzęda v.

The Court reiterates in this respect that there are two separate sets of proceedings enabling the prosecution of a judge and the establishing of his or her criminal liability. The initial proceedings, which relate to the authorisation for the lifting of immunity of a judge, are a condition sine qua non for the subsequent prosecution of a judge; those proceedings are of a judicial nature and the lifting of immunity is decided by a court at two levels of jurisdiction.

That being said, Article 284 § 2 of the Criminal Code establishes an offence that can be committed by the public in general, and not only by a specific category of persons.

Firstly, they noted that, at the time when the application was lodged with the Court, the proceedings for the lifting of the applicant’s judicial immunity had still been pending, in so far as the applicant had not lodged her appeal against the first-instance resolution of the DCSC. Secondly, the Government argued that the applicant had failed to exhaust the available domestic remedies as regards the issue of the composition of the DCSC, given that she had not lodged a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court; had she obtained a favourable judgment of the Constitutional Court, the applicant would have been able to lodge a compensation claim in respect of damage incurred as a result of a final decision given on the basis of provisions which were found to be incompatible with the Constitution, under Article 4171 § 1 of the Civil Code (see Pająk and Others v. Poland, nos. 25226/18 and 3 others, § 38, 24 October 2023). Thirdly, the Government submitted that, following the abolition of the DCSC and the establishment of the Chamber of Professional Liability (“the CPL”) of the Supreme Court in its place (for details see Tuleya, cited above, §§ 181-87), a new remedy was made available to judges affected by the rulings of the DCSC. In particular, the Government referred to the provision under which a judge in respect of whom the DCSC had adopted a final resolution permitting him or her to be held criminally liable was entitled to request the reopening of the proceedings within six months from the date of entry into force of the legislative amendment; such requests for reopening were to be examined by the CPL (ibid., § 187). Against that background, the Government acknowledged that the applicant had been in a different situation than the one covered by the legislative amendment, in so far as the DCSC had refused, at second-instance, to lift her immunity.

Moreover, she asserted that, in the context of the Court’s judgment in Xero Flor w Polsce sp. z o.o. v. Poland (no. 4907/18, 7 May 2021), the constitutional complaint could no longer be considered an effective remedy.", "para_idx": 115}, {"section": "merits", "text": "(b)   The Court’s assessment", "para_idx": 116}, {"section": "merits", "text": "55.  Concerning the allegedly premature character of the complaint on account of the fact that the applicant had lodged her application with this Court before appealing against the first-instance resolution of the DCSC, the Court considers that, irrespective of whether this remedy could be regarded as an effective one for the purposes of Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, the objection as to non-exhaustion has lost its relevance, because in any event it accepts that the last stage of domestic remedies may be reached after the application has been lodged but before its admissibility has been determined (see Molla Sali v.

In Tuleya, the original resolution lifting that applicant’s immunity and suspending him from his judicial duties had similarly been given by DCSC (ibid., §§ 43-44 and 256). However, the subsequent resolution lifting the applicant’s suspension was given by a panel of the CPL, the composition of which was found to raise no concerns under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in the light of the Reczkowicz judgment. The Court took into account, on the one hand, the composition of the body which gave the final decision (ibid., § 258), and on the other, the fact that the CPL panel in question had recognised that the suspension had been ordered by the DCSC – a body that did not meet the requirements of an independent and impartial tribunal established by law within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. The Court therefore found that the CPL had acknowledged – in substance – that there was a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in respect of the proceedings before the DCSC (ibid., § 260; thus, the Court followed the approach adopted in the above-cited case of Freimanis and Līdums, § 72). On this basis, the Court accepted that at last instance Judge Tuleya received a hearing before an “independent and impartial tribunal established by law”, as required by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, notably due to lack of doubts as to the validity of the appointments of the members of the CPL panel concerned (ibid., § 261).

Consequently, following the criteria reiterated in Sakhnovskiy (cited above, § 67 in fine; see paragraph 63 above), the Court finds that the adverse consequences for the applicant (as resulting from the first-instance resolution) appear to no longer persist after the final domestic decision.

In this context, the Court reiterates that the process of appointing judges has fundamental implications for the proper functioning and the legitimacy of the judiciary in a democratic State governed by the rule of law (see Guðmundur Andri Ástráðsson v. Iceland [GC], no. 26374/18, § 227, 1 December 2020). As such, the right in issue would, by design, require, that the body examining a complaint in this respect be free from similar doubts as to its very establishment (as was the case in both cases cited above, that is Tuleya, and Freimanis and Līdums, where the ensuing proceedings were conducted before different compositions).", "para_idx": 138}, {"section": "merits", "text": "Secondly, the second-instance DCSC panel was composed of judges appointed in the same procedure as the judge who examined the case at first instance.

Therefore, the reasons on the basis of which the first-instance resolution had been amended had no connection with the applicant’s allegations concerning the composition of the DCSC. Thus, unlike in the Tuleya case, in the reasons of its resolution the second-instance panel did not recognise that the first-instance panel failed to meet the requirements of a “tribunal established by law”, as per the findings in Reczkowicz. It also did not acknowledge, neither expressly, nor in substance, a violation of the applicant’s right under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention on that account.", "para_idx": 139}, {"section": "merits", "text": "72.  Against that background, and considering that the conditions of acknowledgment and redress for the breach of the Convention are cumulative (see Rooman, cited above, § 129), the Court finds that, in the specific circumstances of the present case, the resolution of 7 June 2021 could not have deprived the applicant of her status as a victim in relation to the complaint under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention that the DCSC had not been a “tribunal established by law”.", "para_idx": 140}, {"section": "merits", "text": "73.  In view of the foregoing, the Government’s preliminary objection as to the applicant’s victim status in respect of the proceedings before the DCSC must be dismissed.", "para_idx": 141}, {"section": "merits", "text": "74.  The Court notes that this complaint is neither manifestly ill-founded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in Article 35 of the Convention.

In that latter respect, citing the Court’s judgment in Reczkowicz (cited above), the applicant referred to the fact that judicial members of the NCJ had been elected by the Sejm and not by their peers, and that the term of office of the previous judicial members had been unlawfully terminated.", "para_idx": 143}, {"section": "merits", "text": "76.  The Government argued that there had been no manifest breach of domestic law with regard to the process of appointing the judges of the DCSC who had heard the applicant’s case.

Accordingly, the applicant’s assertion that the judges adjudicating in her case had been improperly appointed as a result of being subject to unspecified political influence by the NCJ seemed to be devoid of any substantive basis and could not constitute a violation of Article 6 § 1. The Polish legislature could not be accused of violating any standards applicable to the appointment of judges on account of the participation of the Sejm in the election of the judicial members of the NCJ. Although representatives of the legislature and members of the executive, including the Minister of Justice, were members of the NCJ, the independent constitutional authority of the State, they acted only as its members without having a decisive role in making any decisions.

Equally, there was no evidence to demonstrate that on account of the impugned measures the “inner circle” of the applicant’s private life, or her opportunity to establish and develop relationships with others, had been affected.

The Government claimed that those measures had been prompted by the applicant’s conduct, which had been incompatible with the authority of judicial office and was related to a breach of criminal law. The Court finds that the reasons underpinning the impugned measures were linked to the performance of the applicant’s professional duties and had no connection to her private life. It is therefore the consequence-based approach which may bring the issue under Article 8 (see Tuleya, cited above, § 375, and Denisov, cited above, § 107), provided that the consequences for the applicant’s life were very serious and affected her private life to a very significant degree (Denisov, cited above, §§ 114 and 116).", "para_idx": 170}, {"section": "merits", "text": "94.  The Court notes that the applicant contested the very existence of any misconduct on her part.

There are therefore no grounds for applying the Gillberg exclusionary principle as suggested by the Government (see paragraph 86 above, Gillberg v. Sweden [GC], no. 41723/06, § 68, 3 April 2012, and Tuleya, cited above, § 376).", "para_idx": 171}, {"section": "merits", "text": "95.  It remains to be seen, however, whether there has been sufficiently serious prejudice to the applicant’s enjoyment of her right to respect for any of the elements composing her private life, namely: (i) her “inner circle”, (ii) her opportunities to establish and develop relationships with others, or (iii) her reputation (see Denisov, cited above, § 120).", "para_idx": 172}, {"section": "merits", "text": "96.  As to the consequences of the impugned decision for the “inner circle” of the applicant’s private life, the Court notes that, apart from lifting the applicant’s immunity, the DCSC further ordered her suspension from her judicial duties and a 50% reduction of her salary for the duration of the suspension. In that connection, the Court notes, on the one hand, that the level of salary reduction was significant (particularly as it was the maximum reduction that could be imposed – for details, see Tuleya, cited above, § 144) and – on the other hand – that it was a temporary measure, after the ending of which the outstanding remuneration was paid out to her (see paragraph 16 above). That being so, even assuming that the reduction in the applicant’s remuneration did not seriously affect the “inner circle” of her private life, the Court finds that during the relevant period her suspension deprived her of the opportunity to continue her judicial work and to inhabit a professional environment where she could pursue her goals of professional and personal development (see Gumenyuk and Others v.

As such those findings were evidently capable of adversely affecting the applicant’s professional reputation (see Tuleya, cited above, § 384 and the case-law cited therein). A further consequence of the DCSC’s findings was that, in the eyes of at least some members of the public, the applicant could be perceived as being unworthy of holding judicial office (compare and contrast with Xhoxhaj v.

The resolution itself was adopted by the DCSC, which the Court previously found failed to satisfy the requirements of a “independent and impartial tribunal established by law” prescribed in Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see Reczkowicz, cited above, and paragraphs 82-84 above).", "para_idx": 270}, {"section": "merits", "text": "178.  The Court also notes that the finding of the DCSC’s first-instance judge that there was a reasonable suspicion of the applicant having committed offences was overturned on appeal. The Court considers relevant for the issue under review that the second-instance panel of the DCSC found that the allegations of criminal misconduct against the applicant were unsubstantiated (see paragraph 15 above), which would appear to support the applicant’s claim that the measures taken against her by the authorities (that is the criminal investigation into her alleged wrongdoings and the request for lifting her judicial immunity) were aimed at silencing her (see paragraphs 145 and 149 above). It therefore finds that in the circumstances of the case there are grounds to consider that the authorities’ actions culminating in the DCSC’s resolution of 12 October 2020 could be regarded as a disguised sanction for the applicant’s exercise of her freedom of expression.", "para_idx": 271}, {"section": "merits", "text": "179.  Taking account of the above-mentioned context and having regard to the sequence of events in their entirety, rather than as separate and distinct incidents, the Court considers that there is prima facie evidence of a causal link between the applicant’s exercise of her freedom of expression and the DCSC’s decision lifting her immunity and suspending her from her judicial duties.", "para_idx": 272}, {"section": "merits", "text": "180.  The above conclusion is further corroborated by the documents submitted by the applicant which refer to the public perception that such a causal link existed (see paragraph 18 above).", "para_idx": 273}, {"section": "merits", "text": "181.  Irrespective of the above, the Court observes the applicant’s argument that the actions aimed at lifting her immunity were taken some time after her civil claim against the Minister of Justice had been upheld at first instance and while these proceedings were still pending on appeal (see paragraphs 11, 12 and 147 above). It is to be noted, however, that the applicant does not rely on the specific content of her lawsuit or any other submissions lodged with the competent court within those proceedings; rather, she appears to be claiming that the very action of instituting proceedings against the Minister of Justice constituted a form of expression protected under Article 10. The Court reiterates, in this context, that it has already found that forms of conduct such as instituting proceedings may be protected under Article 10 of the Convention (albeit as a form of whistleblowing, such as lodging a criminal complaint against one’s employer – see Heinisch v. Germany, no. 28274/08, § 43, ECHR 2011 (extracts)). However, seeing as the applicant’s activity in public debate, both individually and in her capacity as the President of the Judges’ Association Themis, clearly constituted a form of “expression” protected under Article 10, there is no need to examine whether the applicant’s legal action as such was also covered by that Article.", "para_idx": 274}, {"section": "merits", "text": "182.  The Government argued that the DCSC’s resolution of 12 October 2020 lifting the applicant’s immunity and suspending her from judicial duties was connected with the applicant’s alleged criminal actions, rather than with her exercise of her freedom of expression.

The court went on to find that the disputed statements had been made in the context of Father I. expressing his negative attitude towards the fact that the applicant was representing the interests of the defendant in the so-called “Cyanide case” and, in particular, made reference to another of his statements – “Why defend those murderers, why defend Mamaladze?”. It then examined the statements separately and noted that the term “snitch” was of an evaluative nature similar to an adjective and implied a person’s subjective attitude towards another.

The Supreme Court noted that the above-mentioned evidence could not dispel “the accusations made in the disputed statements”.

In this connection, the Court finds irrelevant the Supreme Court’s finding that these accusations did not amount to Father I. claiming that the applicant had committed either a criminal or administrative offence (see paragraph 14 above). Regardless of whether these statements should have been understood literally as statements of fact or by putting them in a wider context as value judgments – which is a matter to be examined below (see paragraphs 35-37 below) – the Court considers that they were capable of damaging the applicant’s reputation and also fomenting prejudice against him in both his professional and social environments (see Kajganić v. Serbia, no. 27958/16, §§ 61-62, 8 October 2024; see also Dorota Kania v. Poland (no. 2), no. 44436/13, § 73, 4 October 2016; Matalas v. Greece, no. 1864/18, § 45, 25 March 2021, and Mesić v. Croatia, no. 19362/18, § 84, 5 May 2022). Article 8 is therefore applicable in the present case. Accordingly, the Government’s objections of inadmissibility ratione materiae and of no significant disadvantage (see paragraph 20 above), both pertaining to the seriousness of the accusations and their impact on the applicant, must be dismissed.", "para_idx": 58}, {"section": "admissibility", "text": "24.  Furthermore, the Court considers it more appropriate to examine the Government’s remaining arguments concerning the manner in which the domestic courts dealt with the applicant’s defamation claim at the merits stage (see paragraphs 32-39 below).", "para_idx": 59}, {"section": "admissibility", "text": "25.  In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that the application is neither manifestly ill-founded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in Article 35 of the Convention.

The accusation that he had cooperated with the State’s security services in general, and in the context of the high-profile Girgvliani case in particular, had badly damaged his professional reputation. In the absence of any evidence or sources, these statements were clearly defamatory, falling outside the scope of speech which was protected by domestic law and international law standards. The applicant further asserted that the Tbilisi Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court had failed to properly balance the two competing rights protected under Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention. The interference with his rights had not pursued a legitimate aim because the domestic courts had given excessive weight to the protection of Father I.’s freedom of expression at the expense of his reputation.", "para_idx": 61}, {"section": "merits", "text": "27.  The Government submitted that the applicant had failed to produce any evidence supporting his allegation that the disputed statements had impacted his private life.

They further argued that, if the Court were to find Article 8 of the Convention applicable in the present case, they would not deny that there had been an interference with the applicant’s private life. However, the interference in question had been in accordance with the law, it had pursued a legitimate aim, and it had been necessary in a democratic society. The Government noted in this connection that the domestic courts had conducted a detailed balancing exercise between the competing interests protected under Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention and, with due regard to the Court’s case‑law on the subject, had delivered well-reasoned and nuanced decisions. They distinguished the present case from Jishkariani v. Georgia (no. 18925/09, 20 September 2018), noting that what was at the core of the present case was a dispute between two private individuals (unlike in Jishkariani, where the author of the disputed defamatory statements had been a minister) and that the disputed statements had, therefore, carried less weight. The Government reiterated that, in the light of the principle of subsidiarity and the wide margin of appreciation accorded to member States on issues related to the regulation of freedom of expression, the Court’s role in the present case was supervisory only.

The applicable principles are, nonetheless, similar and regard must be had to the fair balance that has to be struck between the relevant competing interests (see Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) [GC], nos. 40660/08 and 60641/08, §§ 98-99, ECHR 2012, with further references), namely, on the one hand, freedom of expression as protected by Article 10 and, on the other, the right to respect for private life enshrined in Article 8 (see Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associés, cited above, §§ 90-93; see the general principles on the balancing of Article 10 and Article 8 of the Convention summarised in Perinçek v. Switzerland [GC], no. 27510/08, § 198, ECHR 2015 (extracts)).", "para_idx": 66}, {"section": "merits", "text": "31.  In order to assess the justification of an impugned statement, a distinction must be made between statements of fact and value judgments in that, while the existence of facts can be demonstrated, the truth of value judgments is not susceptible of proof.

The classification of a statement as a fact or as a value judgment is a matter which in the first place falls within the margin of appreciation of the national authorities, in particular the domestic courts. However, even where a statement amounts to a value judgment, the proportionality of an interference may depend on whether there exists a sufficient “factual basis” for the impugned statement: if there is not, that value judgment may prove excessive. In order to distinguish between a factual allegation and a value judgment, it is necessary to take account of the circumstances of the case and the general tone of the remarks, bearing in mind that assertions about matters of public interest may, on that basis, constitute value judgments rather than statements of fact (see Morice v.

The applicant was accused of having defended the interests of “murderer(s)” and of having been planted as a provocateur in the “Cyanide case”, in a role allegedly similar to that which he had played in the Girgvliani case, where he was said to have provided information to the security services. The Court concurs with the domestic courts’ finding that, at the material time, a debate concerning the so-called “Cyanide case” was ongoing, attracting significant public interest (see, in this connection, Mamaladze v. Georgia, no. 9487/19, §§ 16-32, and 33, 3 November 2022). It has recognised the existence of such an interest, for example, where the publication in question concerned information about criminal proceedings in general (see Dupuis and Others v. France, no. 1914/02, § 42, 7 June 2007, and July and SARL Libération v. France, no. 20893/03, § 66, ECHR 2008 (extracts)) or information regarding a specific criminal case (see White v. Sweden, no. 42435/02, § 29, 19 September 2006, and Egeland and Hanseid v. Norway, no. 34438/04, § 58, 16 April 2009). The so-called “Cyanide case” prompted a broad public discussion concerning the Orthodox Church of Georgia in general and specific issues within the Patriarchy in particular. The disputed statements clearly concerned issues of public interest and attracted wide media coverage (see paragraph 5 above). Accordingly, the Court takes the view that, in the circumstances of the present case, the statements made by Father I. fell within the context of a debate on a matter of public interest.", "para_idx": 71}, {"section": "merits", "text": "(ii)    How well-known the applicant was", "para_idx": 72}, {"section": "merits", "text": "34.  The Court observes that the applicant, a publicly known defence lawyer, was considered by the domestic courts to be a public figure rather than a private person for the purposes of the Freedom of Speech Act. Furthermore, the debate and the disputed statements did not concern the applicant’s private life but his public activities in the above-mentioned domain. Considering the applicant’s position and his involvement in various high-profile criminal cases, the Court does not see any reason to depart from the domestic courts’ finding concerning the applicant’s status as a public figure (see, in this regard, Kajganić, cited above, §§ 66-67). Hence, he voluntarily exposed himself to public scrutiny by virtue of his role as defence counsel in high-profile criminal cases and was, therefore, required to display a higher level of tolerance than would be expected of a non-public figure (see Jishkariani, cited above, § 51).", "para_idx": 73}, {"section": "merits", "text": "(iii)   Content, form and consequences of the statements", "para_idx": 74}, {"section": "merits", "text": "35.  The Court has already found that Father’s I.’s accusations were serious, involving serious allegations of misconduct on the part of the applicant, and suggesting that the applicant had acted, at the very least, in breach of the legal ethical norms (see paragraph 23 above). Yet the appellate court concluded that the disputed statements constituted Father I.’s personal opinions which had been aimed at contributing to an important public discussion on the matter and were to be tolerated by the applicant in view of his status as a public figure (see paragraphs 10-11 above). It held that the disputed statements constituted value judgments which merited absolute protection (ibid.). The Supreme Court engaged in a more nuanced examination of the disputed statements, considering that the last part of the second statement, that the applicant had been planted as provocateur in the Girgvliani case and had been providing information to the former head of the Constitutional Security Department, was rather a statement of fact (see paragraph 14 above).", "para_idx": 75}, {"section": "merits", "text": "36.  In the circumstances of the present case, as far as the first disputed statement concerning the applicant’s role in the Mamaladze case is concerned, even if the Court were to accept the classification of the allegation voiced against the applicant as a value judgment, it notes the conclusions of the Tbilisi Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court to the effect that any value judgment enjoyed absolute protection under the Freedom of Speech Act (see paragraph 13 above). Hence, they did not examine whether there was sufficient factual basis to call the applicant a planted provocateur in the Mamaladze case. The Court finds it difficult to reconcile the domestic courts’ above approach with the Court’s settled case‑law, which holds that even when a statement amounts to a value judgment, there must exist a sufficient factual basis to support it, failing which it will be excessive (see Pedersen and Baadsgaard v.

His representative had expressly indicated before the first-instance judge that he was unaware of any information that could have formed the basis for such statements (see paragraph 9 above). In such circumstances, and having regard to its case-law that the more serious an allegation is, the more solid its factual basis must be (see Barata Monteiro da Costa Nogueira and Patrício Pereira v. Portugal, no. 4035/08, § 38, 11 January 2011; see also Ziembiński v. Poland, no. 46712/06, § 51, 24 July 2012), the Court notes with concern that the domestic courts failed to ascertain whether such a factual basis existed in the present case.", "para_idx": 77}, {"section": "merits", "text": "38.  Furthermore, despite the applicant’s submissions, the seriousness of the accusations, and the absence of any established factual basis for them, the Supreme Court placed the burden of proof on the applicant to rebut them (see paragraph 15 above) and found that the evidence adduced by the applicant had not been sufficient to refute Father I.’s allegations (ibid.).

In accordance with the Constitution, Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of two Entities – the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska (see Article I § 3 of the Constitution) – and the Brčko District in the joint ownership (condominium) of the two Entities (see Article VI § 4 of the Constitution, as amended in 2009).", "para_idx": 6}, {"section": "facts_background", "text": "6.  The Constitution makes a distinction between “constituent peoples” (Bosniacs, Croats and Serbs) and “Others and citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina” (for more information about those categories, see Sejdić and Finci v.

At the State level, a number of power-sharing arrangements were introduced, such as a vital interest veto, an Entity veto, a bicameral system (with a House of Peoples of the Parliamentary Assembly – the second chamber of the State Parliament – composed of five Bosniacs, five Croats and five Serbs) and a collective Head of State[1] – the Presidency – with three members: one Bosniac, one Croat and one Serb (see Articles IV and V of the Constitution).

The country will only be able to cope with the numerous challenges resulting from this situation if there is a strong and effective government. The constitutional rules on the functioning of the State organs are however not designed to produce strong government but to prevent the majority from taking decisions adversely affecting other groups. It is understandable that in a post-conflict situation there was (and is) insufficient trust between ethnic groups to allow government on the basis of the majoritarian principle alone. In such a situation specific safeguards have to be found which ensure that all major groups, in Bosnia and Herzegovina the constituent peoples, can accept the constitutional rules and feel protected by them. As a consequence, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Constitution ensures the protection of the interests of the constituent peoples not only through territorial arrangements reflecting their interests but also through the composition of the State organs and the rules on their functioning. In such a situation, a balance has indeed to be struck between the need to protect the interests of all constituent peoples on the one hand and the need for effective government on the other. However, in the Bosnia and Herzegovina Constitution, there are many provisions ensuring the protection of the interests of the constituent peoples, inter alia: the vital interest veto in the Parliamentary Assembly, the two-chamber system and the collective Presidency on an ethnic basis. The combined effect of these provisions makes effective government extremely difficult, if not impossible.

Due to the existence of the veto, a delegation taking a particularly intransigent position and refusing to compromise is in a strong position. It is true that further case-law from the Constitutional Court may provide a definition of the vital interest and reduce the risks inherent in the mechanism.

One chamber is composed on the basis of population figures while in the other either all entities have the same number of seats (Switzerland, USA) or at least smaller entities are overrepresented (Germany). In Bosnia and Herzegovina this is quite different: in both chambers two-thirds of the members come from the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the difference being that in the House of Peoples only the Bosniacs and Croats from the Federation and the Serbs from the Republika Srpska are represented.

Some legal problems resulting from this approach will be examined below in Part V of this Opinion. However, beyond specific legal problems this approach raises more general concerns. First of all, the interests of persons not belonging to the three constituent peoples risk being neglected or people are forced to artificially identify with one of the three peoples although they may for example be of mixed origin or belong to a different category. Moreover, there is a strong risk that all issues will be regarded in the light of whether a proposal favours the specific interests of the respective peoples and not of whether it contributes to the common weal. Finally, elections cannot fully play their role of allowing political alternance between majority and opposition. Each individual is free to change his political party affiliation.

That being said, in order for an applicant to be able to claim to be a victim in such circumstances, he or she must produce reasonable and convincing evidence of the likelihood that a violation affecting him or her personally will occur; mere suspicion or conjecture is insufficient in this respect (see Kovačević, cited above, §§ 166-71, with further references).", "para_idx": 80}, {"section": "admissibility", "text": "31.  Turning to the present case, there is no dispute that those who do not declare affiliation with the “constituent peoples”, like the applicant, cannot take part in the election for the Chair and the Deputy Chairs of the House of Representatives.

Violations which are purely technical and are insignificant save from a formalistic point of view do not merit European supervision. The assessment of this minimum level is relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case. The severity of a violation should be assessed by taking into account both the applicant’s subjective perceptions and what is objectively at stake in a particular case.

The Court has held that for such “abuse” to be established on the part of an applicant, the conduct in question must not only be manifestly contrary to the purpose of the right of application but also impede the proper functioning of the Court or the proper conduct of the proceedings before it (ibid., § 34).", "para_idx": 96}, {"section": "merits", "text": "43.  Turning to the Government’s specific assertions, the Court has already considered that an application motivated by publicity or political propaganda does not, by that very fact alone, constitute an abuse of the right of application (see Lawless v.

More importantly, nothing indicates that the applicant has had an irresponsible and frivolous attitude towards the proceedings that are pending before the Court (see Georgian Labour Party v. Georgia (dec.), no. 9103/04, 22 May 2007), or that he has been deliberately seeking to undermine the machinery of the Convention and the functioning of the Court (contrast Zambrano, cited above, § 38).", "para_idx": 97}, {"section": "merits", "text": "44.  As regards the applicant’s remarks that the acting Agent did not have the formal power to represent the Government, the Court reiterates that an application may indeed be rejected as an abuse of the right of petition within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention if the applicant has used particularly vexatious, contemptuous, threatening or provocative language – whether this be against the respondent Government, their Agent, the authorities of the respondent State, the Court itself, its judges, its Registry or members thereof. However, it does not suffice that the applicant’s language was sharp, polemical or sarcastic; to be considered an abuse, it must exceed the limits of normal, civic and legitimate criticism (see Zhdanov and Others v. Russia, nos. 12200/08 and 2 others, § 80, 16 July 2019).

The Government also referred, in this connection, to remarks made by other persons (notably, the applicant in Kovačević, cited above).

In Roman Zakharov (cited above, § 231) the Court confirmed that the same six minimum safeguards also applied in cases where the interception was for reasons of national security; however, in determining whether the impugned legislation was in breach of Article 8, it also had regard to the authorisation procedures, to the scope and duration of the secret surveillance measures, to the arrangements for supervising its implementation, to the existence of notification mechanisms and to the remedies provided for by national law (see Roman Zakharov, cited above, § 238; Centrum för rättvisa, cited above, §§ 249-51; and Big Brother Watch and Others, cited above, §§ 335‑37).", "para_idx": 99}, {"section": "merits", "text": "64.  Finally, in cases such as the present one, where the applicants complained in abstracto about a system of secret surveillance rather than of specific instances of such surveillance, the relevant national laws and practices are to be scrutinised as they stand at the time when the Court examines the admissibility of the application, rather than as they stood when it was lodged (see Centrum för rättvisa, cited above, §§ 147 and 150-51; Big Brother Watch and Others, cited above, § 270; and Pietrzak and Bychawska‑Siniarska and Others v.

These measures include the secret observation of individuals, places (private premises or places open to the public) or vehicles; the gathering of information about what has happened in such places and the recording of such happenings by technical tools, such as video or audio recording. They also include the obtaining of data necessary to establish the communication via electronic devices or to identify or locate such devices. In view of its case‑law (cited above in paragraph 59) and the fact that section 63(1) of the Police Act itself defines secret intelligence gathering as an activity that restricts someone’s right to respect for their home, correspondence and personal data, the Court sees no reason to rule otherwise.", "para_idx": 103}, {"section": "merits", "text": "67.  As the Court has found an interference under Article 8 § 1 with regard to the applicants’ general complaint about the relevant rules of the Police Act, rather than any actual activity allegedly taking place, when examining the justification for the interference (see paragraphs 61–62 above) the Court is required to examine the legislation itself and the safeguards against the misuse of power incorporated into the system allowing for secret surveillance, rather than the proportionality of any specific measures taken with regard to the applicants (Szabó and Vissy v. Hungary, cited above, § 58).", "para_idx": 104}, {"section": "merits", "text": "68.  The Court’s assessment of whether such guarantees exist and are adequate against abuse depends on the circumstances of the case.", "para_idx": 105}, {"section": "merits", "text": "69.  In the light of the specific characteristics of integrity testing and the nature of the interference in question with the applicants’ exercise of their rights protected by Article 8 of the Convention, the Court considers that, in the present case, integrity testing and the secret intelligence gathering measures it potentially involves should be subjected to safeguards similar to those applied to the interception of communications in criminal investigations (see paragraph 63 above). In view of the applicants’ complaints about the deficiencies in domestic legislation, the Court’s assessment will focus on elements of the legislation which are alleged to fall short of the requirements under Article 8 of the Convention: the scope and authorisation of integrity testing and secret surveillance measures, the existence of notification mechanisms and the remedies provided for by national law.", "para_idx": 106}, {"section": "merits", "text": "70.  The Court notes that, since its introduction in 2011, the categories of individuals subject to integrity testing under the Police Act have gradually been extended (see paragraphs 5, 6, 15–16 above), to include, among others, and with a few exceptions, all employees of healthcare service providers maintained by the state or local governments and all employees of different public bodies headed by or under the direction or supervision of the Minister of the Interior.", "para_idx": 107}, {"section": "merits", "text": "71.  As stated in the Government’s submissions, the aim of those legislative amendments was to curb corruption amongst civil servants and the solicitation of or acceptance of gratuities in the provision of healthcare services.

There is no indication concerning the grounds or considerations on the basis of which such integrity testing can be ordered. The Court notes in this connection that, under section 7/A(2) of the Police Act, integrity testing can be conducted not only in relation to named individuals but also in relation to individuals whose identity is still unknown at the time the order is made. This further reinforces the indiscriminate nature of the ordering of integrity tests.", "para_idx": 110}, {"section": "merits", "text": "74.  The Government did not explain the indiscriminate nature of the measures in question, nor did they provide relevant and sufficient reasons to support the necessity thereof.", "para_idx": 111}, {"section": "merits", "text": "75.  Even though the head of the NPS must provide reasons for ordering the integrity testing (see paragraphs 19–20 above), the mere requirement for the authorities to give reasons for the application of the measure, arguing for its necessity, falls short of an assessment of strict necessity (see Szabó and Vissy, cited above, § 71). There is no indication in domestic law that the NPS would need to produce supporting materials, or a sufficient factual basis for the application of integrity testing and any accompanying secret intelligence gathering measures. This would enable the prosecutor’s office, as a supervisory authority (see paragraphs 21 and 27 above), to ascertain whether the ordered measure meets the requirement of “necessity in a democratic society”, as provided by Article 8 § 2 of the Convention, including whether it is proportionate to the legitimate aims pursued, by verifying, for example, whether it would be possible to achieve the aims by less restrictive means (Roman Zakharov, cited above, § 260).", "para_idx": 112}, {"section": "merits", "text": "76.  In view of the above, the Court finds that the legislation governing integrity testing lacks adequate safeguards against broadening the scope of possible secret surveillance beyond what is strictly necessary for the protection of democratic institutions.", "para_idx": 113}, {"section": "merits", "text": "77.  Concerning the existence of any notification mechanisms and the remedies provided for by national law, the Court reiterates its previous finding that the question of subsequent notification of surveillance measures is inextricably linked to the effectiveness of remedies (see Weber and Saravia, cited above, § 135; Roman Zakharov, cited above, § 286; and, more recently, in the context of criminal prosecution, Klaudia Csikós v. Hungary, no. 31091/16, § 60, 28 November 2024). Under section 7/A(3) of the Police Act, the subject of the integrity test must be informed about the termination of the procedure within 15 working days. However, the Court finds it relevant that the person concerned is only informed that an integrity testing procedure has been conducted against him or her and that it has been terminated, without he or her having access to any further details about the procedure itself. Nor does domestic law allow the person concerned to be informed as to whether any measure of secret information gathering was used during the integrity testing procedure. These gaps in the notification system make it inherently difficult for the person concerned to subsequently seek a remedy for the application of the measures in question. The national law thus eschewed an important safeguard against the unlawful or arbitrary use of integrity testing or special means of surveillance (see Association for European Integration and Human Rights and Ekimdzhiev, cited above, §§ 90-91; and Roman Zakharov, cited above, § 288).", "para_idx": 114}, {"section": "merits", "text": "78.  The Court takes note that Hungarian law provides for criminal sanctions for unauthorised integrity testing under Article 308 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 34 above). However, for the reasons set out in the preceding paragraph, the effectiveness of this remedy is questionable in light of the fact that information about the details of an integrity test conducted against a person, including its authorisation and whether any measure of secret information gathering was used during the testing procedure remain inaccessible to the person concerned. The Court further doubts whether it constitutes an adequate remedy in relation to complaints that do not question compliance with the rules governing the approval of integrity testing by the prosecutor, but rather whether integrity testing and the measures applied in its course were necessary and proportionate in the given circumstances. This remedy’s effectiveness is therefore undermined by the shortcomings of the notification system mentioned above (compare Roman Zakharov, cited above, §§ 297-98) and the fact that punishable conduct is limited to the violations of the rules governing the prosecutor’s approval of integrity testing.", "para_idx": 115}, {"section": "merits", "text": "79.  In light of the above, it does not appear that the applicants had effective access to an independent and impartial body with jurisdiction to examine any complaint relating to unlawful integrity testing or secret intelligence gathering (see paragraphs 11 and 45 above), independently of a notification that such measures had taken place (Klaudia Csikós, cited above, § 61).", "para_idx": 116}, {"section": "merits", "text": "80.  The foregoing considerations are sufficient for the Court to conclude that the provisions in the Police Act relating to integrity testing and the use of secret surveillance which it can involve fail to satisfy the requirements of Article 8 of the Convention, since the domestic legal framework does not meet the “quality of law” requirement and cannot ensure that the resulting interferences are limited to what is “necessary in a democratic society”.", "para_idx": 117}, {"section": "merits", "text": "81.  There has accordingly been a violation of Article 8 of the Convention.", "para_idx": 118}, {"section": "merits", "text": "82.  Article 41 of the Convention provides:", "para_idx": 119}, {"section": "merits", "text": "“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”", "para_idx": 120}, {"section": "merits", "text": "83.  The first applicant claimed 10,000 euros (EUR) in respect of non‑pecuniary damage.

Only where both these conditions have been satisfied does the subsidiary nature of the protective mechanism of the Convention preclude the examination of the application (see Selahattin Demirtaş v. Turkey (no. 2) [GC], no. 14305/17, § 218, 22 December 2020). As to the redress which is appropriate and sufficient in order to remedy a breach of a Convention right at national level, the Court has generally considered this to be dependent on all the circumstances of the case, having regard, in particular, to the nature of the Convention violation at stake. In cases of wilful ill-treatment by State agents in breach of Article 3, the State authorities must have conducted an effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and, if appropriate, punishment of those responsible (see Tsaava and Others v.

An award of compensation to the applicant is required where appropriate, or, at least, the possibility of seeking and obtaining compensation for the damage which the applicant sustained as a result of the ill-treatment.

In particular, the Constitutional Court found a breach of Article 39 § 3 of the Constitution, which provides procedural safeguards in respect of the expulsion of foreigners (see paragraph 45 above). It held that this provision had been breached because the applicants were expelled without a prior examination of their removal on an individual basis and contrary to the instructions issued by the Misdemeanour Court (see paragraphs 27-29 above and compare with the applicants’ complaints in paragraph 79 below). It further found a violation of Article 25 of the Constitution in relation to the applicants’ allegation that they had been expelled from Serbia during the night in freezing conditions, corresponding to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention (see paragraph 29 above). Lastly, the Constitutional Court found a violation of Article 27 § 3 and Article 29 § 1 of the Constitution in connection with the applicants’ complaint that they had not been provided with legal assistance following their arrest and had been unable to challenge the lawfulness of their detention (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above). This corresponds to a violation of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention. Accordingly, the first condition is satisfied in respect of certain aspects of the applicants’ complaints under Articles 3 and 5 of the Convention (for the full scope of the applicants’ complaints under Article 3 see paragraphs 90, 91, 113, 120, 128, and 135 below, and under Article 5 see paragraphs 150 and 161-163 below).", "para_idx": 111}, {"section": "admissibility", "text": "72.  As to the redress afforded to the applicants, the Court notes that the Constitutional Court awarded each of them EUR 1,000 in respect of non‑pecuniary damage resulting from all the violations it had found, and that those sums were duly paid.

Therefore, the question before the Court is whether the Supreme Administrative Court’s conclusion that the applicant lacked locus standi – allegedly without allowing him to present decisive evidence to prove his interest – and the subsequent summary dismissal of his complaint by the Constitutional Court amounted to a disproportionate interference with his ability to have his dispute determined, as guaranteed by domestic law (see, mutatis mutandis, Zubac, cited above, § 74).", "para_idx": 44}, {"section": "merits", "text": "38.  The Court, firstly, observes that the Supreme Administrative Court’s decision not to examine the merits of the applicant’s case was based on the absence of the locus standi.

Nevertheless, the Trabzon Administrative Court examined the merits of his case, ultimately dismissing the application and finding the decision waiving the requirement for an EIA to be lawful. On appeal, the applicant provided no arguments as to his legal standing, focusing exclusively on the merits of the case (see paragraph 9 above). The Supreme Administrative Court then conducted a review of its own motion of the UYAP records. Finding no evidence that the applicant resided in the area or owned property there, it set aside the first‑instance court’s decision, concluding that the case should have been dismissed from the outset on account of the applicant’s lack of standing. In the light of these observations, the Court sees no reason to doubt that the manner in which the Supreme Administrative Court carried out its examination of the case pursued a legitimate aim, namely the observance of the rule of law and proper administration of justice.", "para_idx": 46}, {"section": "merits", "text": "40.  It remains, therefore, to be ascertained whether, in the light of all the relevant circumstances of the case, there was a reasonable relationship of proportionality between that aim and the means employed to attain it (compare Zubac, cited above, §§101-06).", "para_idx": 47}, {"section": "merits", "text": "41.  Firstly, the Court notes that the domestic courts consistently applied well-established case-law which requires a demonstrable link with an affected area, such as residence or property ownership in the vicinity, to assess natural persons’ standing in environmental proceedings (compare Cangı and Others, cited above, § 37, and Cannavacciuolo and Others v. Italy, nos. 51567/14 and 3 others, § 249 in fine, 30 January 2025). The parties’ submissions of relevant domestic case-law also confirm the established approach in this field (see paragraphs 21 and 32 above).

The Court therefore dismisses the applicant’s argument that he would have provided such information had the Supreme Court requested it, given that he had already failed to respond to the explicit request from the lower court (compare Zubac, cited above, §§114-21). As for the applicant’s assertion that the Supreme Administrative Court should have been aware of his current property records through other administrative proceedings related to the same project (see paragraphs 6 and 23 above), the Court points out that the applicant’s submissions to the domestic courts merely cited the case file numbers of those other proceedings without providing any information or evidence regarding his residency or property ownership in the area.

It cannot therefore assume the role of dictating the manner of application of domestic courts’ power to examine issues of their own motion, which clearly falls within the margin of appreciation of the Contracting States (see Zubac, § 79). In view of the applicant’s failure to raise his property ownership status before the domestic courts with the requisite diligence, and noting he was legally represented throughout the domestic proceedings, the Court sees no reason to determine whether the Supreme Administrative Court should have consulted other records or investigated potential inheritance-related technicalities to ascertain the most up to date version of the land registry information in the applicant’s case (see also Zubac, cited above, § 121).", "para_idx": 50}, {"section": "merits", "text": "44.  The Court observes that the applicant raised his claim of inherited property ownership for the first time and submitted relevant documents in his individual application to the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 11 above).

The Court reiterates that, when assessing the application of Article 6 § 1 to superior courts, the entirety of the domestic proceedings and the role of the superior courts must be given due consideration. In this connection, the conditions for the admissibility of an appeal before those courts may be stricter than those for an ordinary appeal (see Zubac, cited above, § 82). Considering the overall conduct of the proceedings in the lower-level courts (see paragraphs 39-43 above) and given that the applicant had already been granted a hearing by a first-instance court and a subsequent examination by a court of appeal with full jurisdiction, the Court finds that the Constitutional Court’s summary dismissal of the complaint cannot, by itself, be regarded as a denial of access to a court.", "para_idx": 51}, {"section": "merits", "text": "45.  The Court reiterates that the observance of procedural rules is a valuable and important aspect of the administration of justice.

However, the Court has consistently held that the right of access to a court can be impaired where the rules of procedure, rather than serving the aims of legal certainty and the proper administration of justice, act as a barrier that prevents a litigant from having their case determined on the merits by the competent court (see Zubac, cited above, §§ 96-99). In this context, the Court reiterates that the applicant had sufficient opportunity to substantiate his allegations before the lower courts and notes that no apparent issue of unfairness arose during the domestic proceedings.

The domestic law did not contain any legal provisions permitting detention pending proceedings to activate a suspended sentence. The application of criminal provisions “by analogy” was prohibited by Article 3 of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 100 below). He also submitted that his name had been unlawfully placed on the list of wanted persons, given the fact that he had notified the FSIN that he was receiving medical treatment in Germany (see paragraph 24 above). The Khimki police’s allegations that he had failed to report to the local FSIN office on many occasions had not been supported by any documents. Furthermore, the proceedings before the Town Court had not been adversarial because the court had copied verbatim the Khimki police’s application for detention (see paragraph 30 above) into its decision and had not summarised – let alone addressed – the applicant’s arguments. The court had not been independent because the hearing had taken place at the Khimki police station  the same police entity that had initiated the detention request  without any legal basis for holding the hearing outside the court building. This had also prevented the public and the press from attending the hearing, even though the hearing had not been formally closed to the public. The police had let in only three journalists and several members of the public – all selected by themselves. The applicant had been unable to consult his counsel from the time of his arrest until the start of the detention hearing.

Although it applied to the Criminal Code, the prohibition on applying legal provisions by analogy did not apply to the Code of Criminal Procedure or to the Code on the Execution of Sentences. A different interpretation of the domestic law would have rendered impossible the execution of the applicant’s criminal sentence. Given that the applicant’s name had been placed on the list of wanted persons, his detention had been necessary in order to ensure his participation (in accordance with Article 399 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, see paragraph 105 below) in the hearing of the FSIN’s application for his suspended sentence to be activated. The only way to ensure the participation of a convicted person who had evaded supervision was to place him in detention for the period necessary for a decision to be reached on the competent authorities’ application for the activation of the suspended sentence. The FSIN’s detention request had been reasoned and supported by documents.

Despite receiving multiple warnings regarding the potential activation of his suspended sentence, he had changed his place of residence without properly notifying the authorities, had evaded supervision, and had been ultimately declared a wanted person.

The City Court then restated the reasoning of the District Court as regards the expiration of the probation term and the Court’s judgment of 17 October 2017 (see paragraph 39 above). The proceedings had met the statutory procedural requirements. The applicant had been able to consult his counsel in private. The court deemed that the applicant’s allegations that the activation of his prison sentence was politically motivated and associated with a risk to life and health were unsubstantiated.

The Court has indicated that “flagrant denial of justice” is a stringent test of unfairness; it goes beyond mere irregularities or lack of safeguards in the trial procedures. What is required is a breach of the principles of a fair trial guaranteed by Article 6 which is so fundamental as to amount to a nullification, or destruction of the very essence, of the right guaranteed by that Article. Although it has not yet been required to define the term in more precise terms, the Court has nonetheless indicated that certain forms of unfairness could amount to a flagrant denial of justice. These have included: conviction in absentia, with no possibility of subsequently obtaining a fresh determination of the merits of the charge; a trial which is summary in nature and conducted with a total disregard for the rights of the defence; detention without access to an independent and impartial tribunal to have the legality of the detention reviewed; the deliberate and systematic refusal of access to a lawyer – especially for an individual detained in a foreign country; and the admission of evidence obtained by torture (see Willcox and Hurford v. the United Kingdom (dec.), nos. 43759/10 and 43771/12, § 95, 8 January 2013 and the references cited therein; Hammerton v. the United Kingdom, no. 6287/10, §§ 98 and 99, 17 March 2016; and Al-Hawsawi v.

Consequently, the decisions reached by the domestic courts in the applicant’s criminal case had been “arbitrary and manifestly unreasonable”.

Where the “lawfulness” of detention is in issue, including the question whether “a procedure prescribed by law” has been followed, the Convention refers essentially to national law and lays down the obligation to conform to the substantive and procedural rules of that law (see Denis and Irvine v. Belgium [GC], nos. 62819/17 and 63921/17, § 125, 1 June 2021).", "para_idx": 159}, {"section": "merits", "text": "140.  In laying down that any deprivation of liberty must be carried out “in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law”, Article 5 § 1 primarily requires any arrest or detention to have a legal basis in domestic law.

They also relate to the quality of the law, requiring it to be compatible with the rule of law, a concept inherent in all Articles of the Convention. On this last point, the Court stresses that, where deprivation of liberty is concerned, it is particularly important that the general principle of legal certainty be satisfied. It is therefore essential that the conditions for deprivation of liberty under domestic law be clearly defined and that the law itself be foreseeable in its application, so that it meets the standard of “lawfulness” set by the Convention, a standard which requires that all law be sufficiently precise to allow the person – if need be, with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail (see Khlaifia and Others v. Italy [GC], no. 16483/12, §§ 91‑92, 15 December 2016; Del Río Prada, cited above, § 125; and Denis and Irvine, cited above, § 128).", "para_idx": 160}, {"section": "merits", "text": "141.  In legislation and case-law in respect of matters concerning deprivation of liberty, a high level of legal certainty, clarity and foreseeability of the law is required (see Kolevi v.

However, none of the provisions referred to by the domestic courts expressly provided for detention in this specific scenario; those provisions were tailored to other specific scenarios – none of which was applicable to the applicant’s situation. The domestic courts found that those provisions could be applied “by analogy” to the applicant’s situation (see paragraph 38 above). The domestic courts therefore introduced an interpretation in their case-law that ran counter to the wording of the applicable statutory provisions. They did not refer to any authoritative interpretation of the cited provisions by the Supreme or Constitutional Courts of Russia that confirmed that they could apply to detention pending proceedings for the activation of a suspended sentence. Nor has it been demonstrated that there was longstanding and settled case-law supporting the application of the cited provisions in such situations (compare I.L. v. Switzerland, no. 72939/16, §§ 48-58, 3 December 2019, and Borer v. Switzerland, no. 22493/06, §§ 45-47, 10 June 2010). The courts’ interpretation that there was a statutory basis for detention pending the outcome of activation proceedings appears to have been arrived at for the first time in the applicant’s case. The reasoning of the courts in reaching this conclusion did not refer in any way to the need to exercise restraint within a context involving deprivation of liberty (a fundamental right under the Convention); rather, it justified its conclusion merely on the basis that the prohibition on application “by analogy” was restricted to the interpretation of substantive criminal law and did not apply to procedural criminal law. The interpretation which concluded that there existed such a statutory power in these particular circumstances was both novel and expansive.

It sentenced her to seven and a half years’ imprisonment and a ban on holding managerial and financial positions in public and local self-government bodies for a period of three years. In particular, as regards the charge of illegal entrepreneurship under Article 192.2.2, the court found her guilty on account of broadcasting without a licence and working without accreditation (as described in detail in paragraph 10 above). As regards the charge of tax evasion under Article 231.1 of the Criminal Code, it appears that the court mainly relied on an interim audit report by the Ministry of Taxes of 19 January 2015, issued at the request of the prosecuting authorities, and on a forensic accounting report of 13 February 2015, as well as testimony by the authors of those reports and a number of bank documents. The reports stated, inter alia, that, while during its operations Azadliq Radio made various payments in connection with the collection of information as well as other related expenses, it was not possible to identify the purpose and destination of some of those payments. Some money was paid to individuals who did not work for it and its bank statements did not indicate the purpose and destination of certain payments. Some of the documents confirming the purpose and destination of payments were missing from the documents obtained for audit. As a result of those payments being made for unknown purposes and to unknown destinations, it was determined that Azadliq Radio had engaged in activities not aligning with its main activity as defined in its charter.

Moreover, under the relevant provisions of the Law on Media, accreditation of foreign journalists with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was not a precondition for journalistic activity, but merely a right that granted access to more opportunities to receive information. The domestic law did not provide for any criminal or other form of liability for not obtaining accreditation and it was erroneous to characterise journalistic activity without applying for accreditation as illegal entrepreneurship.

As such, it could not be subject to profit tax. Moreover, Azadliq Radio only received money from its parent entity in Prague and classifying the entire amount transferred to it during the period between 1 July 2008 to 1 October 2010 (amounting to AZN 1,354,368 in total for that period) as “profit” had been a “clear manifestation of prejudice” against the applicant. That amount had not been profit, rather it had merely represented the necessary and minimal expenses needed for Azadliq Radio to continue functioning (such as rent, employees’ salaries, fees to be paid to contract-based workers and repairs). Moreover, as head of the Baku bureau of Azadliq Radio, the applicant had not had financial tasks and had not been responsible for paying taxes or social contributions and, according to her employment contract, she had only had a coordinating role between the Baku bureau and the main office in Prague (see, for more detail, Khadija Ismayilova (no. 2), cited above, §§ 8-9). The applicant also argued, in respect of the interim audit report of 19 January 2015, that the Tax Code did not provide for an “interim report” (aralıq aktı) and that the report and its contents had not been in compliance with the requirements of the Tax Code (the specific provisions relied on by the applicant are summarised in paragraphs 25-28 below). The report had not determined the issues of liability, nor had it specifically explained for what exactly the applicant had been responsible, and no decision had been made to hold her accountable for violating tax legislation.

In respect of the offence of tax evasion, it found that, based on the available evidence, the applicant, as the head of the Baku bureau of Azadliq Radio during the period between 1 July 2008 and 1 October 2010, was responsible for the under-reporting and non-payment of profit tax in the amount of AZN 45,145.63.

As to the latter two criminal offences, it repeated the lower courts’ reasoning and did not address any of her specific arguments in detail, dismissing them in general terms by stating that they could not be a basis for concluding that she had not committed those criminal offences. The Supreme Court reduced the applicant’s sentence to three and a half years’ imprisonment suspended on probation for a period of five years. She was released from detention.

She argued that the amendment clarified the meaning of the phrase “State registration” in the definition of the criminal offence of illegal entrepreneurship, by limiting it to tax registration only and, since she had been duly registered as a taxpayer, she could not have been held liable for conducting entrepreneurial activities without State registration.", "para_idx": 22}, {"section": "facts_proceedings", "text": "19.  By a decision of 8 August 2016, the Baku Court of Serious Crimes partly dismissed and partly granted the applicant’s request.

The court therefore re‑classified the offence under Article 192.1 of the Criminal Code and reduced the sentence imposed under that charge to four months’ imprisonment, as well as further reducing her total merged sentence from three and a half years’ imprisonment suspended on probation to two years and three months’ imprisonment suspended on probation.", "para_idx": 23}, {"section": "facts_proceedings", "text": "20.  Following a series of appeals, by a final decision of 16 February 2017 the Supreme Court upheld that decision.

It further noted in that regard that, under the Law on Media, the provisions of which remained in force and unchanged, foreign mass media outlets and their representatives were required to be accredited through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs before they could operate within the country, and that therefore tax registration alone was insufficient for their activity. The court further noted that, contrary to the applicant’s argument, engaging in journalistic or business activity without such accreditation did not, by itself, entail criminal liability; such activity constituted illegal entrepreneurship if, in addition, it caused significant or large damage to citizens, organisations or the State, or generated a significant or large amount of income. In the applicant’s specific case, the court found that she had failed to obtain the required accreditation while she had been the head of the Baku bureau of Azadliq Radio and that, subsequently, from 2010 to 2014, she had conducted entrepreneurial activities generating income amounting to AZN 79,480.

More generally, the Court points out that it is primarily for the national authorities, notably the courts, to resolve problems of interpretation of domestic legislation (see Rohlena v. the Czech Republic [GC], no. 59552/08, § 51, ECHR 2015, and Jidic v. Romania, no. 45776/16, § 83, 18 February 2020). The Court also observes that it is not its task to substitute itself for the domestic courts as regards the assessment of the facts and their legal classification (see Rohlena, cited above, § 51), or to rule on the applicant’s individual criminal responsibility (see Kononov, cited above, § 187).", "para_idx": 87}, {"section": "merits", "text": "47.  However, the Court points out that its powers of review must be greater when the Convention right itself, Article 7 in the present case, requires that there was a legal basis for a conviction and sentence. Article 7 § 1 requires the Court to examine whether there was a contemporaneous legal basis for the applicant’s conviction and, in particular, it must satisfy itself that the result reached by the relevant domestic courts was compatible with Article 7 of the Convention, even if there were differences between the legal approach and reasoning of this Court and the relevant domestic decisions. To accord a lesser power of review to this Court would render Article 7 devoid of purpose (see Kononov, cited above, § 198; Rohlena, cited above, § 52; and Vasiliauskas, cited above, § 161).", "para_idx": 88}, {"section": "merits", "text": "48.  In short, the Court’s function is to consider, from the standpoint of Article 7 § 1 of the Convention, whether the applicant’s act, at the time when it was committed, constituted an offence defined with sufficient accessibility and foreseeability by domestic or international law (see Korbely v. Hungary [GC], no. 9174/02, § 73, ECHR 2008; Kononov, cited above, § 187; and Vasiliauskas, cited above, § 162).", "para_idx": 89}, {"section": "merits", "text": "(b)   Application of the principles to the present case", "para_idx": 90}, {"section": "merits", "text": "49.  In the present case, in addition to the offence of tax evasion, the applicant was ultimately convicted of the offence of illegal entrepreneurship committed for the purpose of generating a large amount of income under Article 192.2.2 of the Criminal Code, later re-classified as the offence of illegal entrepreneurship under Article 192.1 of the Criminal Code (see paragraphs 19-20 above). The Court must verify whether the acts attributed to her fell within a definition of that criminal offence which was sufficiently foreseeable.", "para_idx": 91}, {"section": "merits", "text": "50.  The Court notes at the outset that part of the applicant’s submissions and essentially the entirety of the Government’s submissions in respect of this complaint focused on whether or not the 2016 amendment to Article 192 of the Criminal Code limited the scope of the offence of illegal entrepreneurship by limiting the meaning of words “State registration” to tax registration only. The Court considers that resolving this disagreement is not crucial for the purposes of the present complaint because, even accepting the domestic courts’ and the Government’s position that the relevant amendment did not limit the scope of the offence, it considers, for the reasons it will set out below, that finding the applicant guilty under Article 192 of the Criminal Code was problematic from the standpoint of Article 7 of the Convention. The Government did not comment on the applicant’s other, broader arguments that accreditation as a journalist could not in any event be equated with “State registration” within the meaning of Article 192 of the Criminal Code and that the domestic law did not clearly provide that the acts attributed to her, namely working as a representative of a foreign media outlet without accreditation, were criminalised (see paragraphs 34-37 above).", "para_idx": 92}, {"section": "merits", "text": "51.  The Court also notes that the Government have not produced any decisions of domestic courts, whether of the higher courts or courts of first instance, demonstrating that, prior to the judgments delivered in the present case, it had been explicitly held that working as a foreign journalist or representative of a foreign media outlet without accreditation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs constituted a criminal offence of illegal entrepreneurship, that is “conducting entrepreneurial activity without State registration” (compare, mutatis mutandis, Pessino v. France, no. 40403/02, § 34, 10 October 2006, and Dragotoniu and Militaru-Pidhorni v. Romania, nos. 77193/01 and 77196/01, § 42, 24 May 2007; and contrast Georgouleas and Nestoras v. Greece, nos. 44612/13 and 45831/13, § 63, 28 May 2020). Furthermore, even though, as noted above, the Government argued extensively that the amendment to Article 192 of the Criminal Code did not limit the scope of the criminal offence, no clear definition of the wider scope of the term “State registration” within the meaning of Article 192 was provided in the present case either by the courts or by the Government with reference to any other provisions of the domestic law or judicial decisions.", "para_idx": 93}, {"section": "merits", "text": "52.  As to the lack of such “State registration” in the present case, the domestic courts held that the applicant had engaged in journalistic activity without being accredited by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a representative of foreign media, as required by Articles 50 and 53 of the Law on Media. However, the Court notes in this regard, firstly, that the applicant consistently brought to the domestic courts’ attention the fact that, during the period in question, namely between 1 October 2010 and 1 December 2014, she had no longer been an employee of Azadliq Radio but had been a freelance journalist working with various media outlets, both domestic and foreign, on the basis of civil-law contracts. Accordingly, she had been an Azerbaijani journalist working in Azerbaijan on a freelance basis and had not represented any particular media outlet, either domestic or foreign. However, the courts did not at all address the applicant’s arguments in that regard and it is not clear on what basis they concluded that she should be considered as a “representative of a foreign media outlet” within the meaning of Article 53 of the Law on Media. That approach essentially meant that any domestic journalist who collaborated with a foreign media outlet in any non-exclusive way could be considered a foreign journalist or a representative of a foreign media outlet, which would amount to the arbitrarily extensive application of the law. The Court therefore considers that it could not have been sufficiently foreseeable for the applicant that, in her particular situation, her status would be equated in such an arbitrary manner to a “representative of a foreign media outlet”.", "para_idx": 94}, {"section": "merits", "text": "53.  Secondly, the Court notes that the domestic courts held that the Law on Media “required” accreditation for foreign journalists and representatives of foreign media outlets. In other words, in the present case, the courts regarded accreditation as some form of precondition, akin to a work permit, for lawful journalistic activity for foreign correspondents. However, having had regard to the text of Article 53 of that Law, which regulated activities of representatives of foreign media, the Court notes that, in respect of accreditation, it merely referred back to Article 50 of that same Law, noting that accreditation of foreign correspondents was carried out under the same procedure as provided in that Article. It imposed no additional conditions on foreign correspondents other than specifying that accreditation of foreign correspondents was carried out by the “relevant executive authority” (which was the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for this particular procedure). Turning to Article 50 of the Law on Media, the Court notes that, at the material time, it stated that “mass media outlets may accredit their journalists ...” with various bodies and explained that such accreditation entailed access to advance information about meetings, consultations and other events, as well as access to various relevant documents. In other words, the accreditation procedure was formulated in that provision as a possibility, and not a requirement, and specified that accredited journalists had thereby acquired a right of additional or privileged access to certain types of information. This is further confirmed by the provisions of the fifth paragraph of Article 53 of the Law on Media, which further regulated rights and obligations of “foreign correspondents who [were] not accredited in accordance with established procedures”, as well as by the lack in both the Law on Media, as well as any other domestic law, of any provisions expressly providing for any form of liability for not obtaining accreditation.", "para_idx": 95}, {"section": "merits", "text": "54.  In such circumstances, the Court cannot but conclude that there was no clear legal basis for the domestic courts’ finding that accreditation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was a requirement for foreign journalists. However, the domestic courts of all three levels of jurisdiction merely briefly held that the applicant had worked as a representative of a foreign media outlet without obtaining the required accreditation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, thus engaging in “entrepreneurial activity without State registration” which constituted a criminal offence of illegal entrepreneurship. They provided no further reasoning and did not attempt to give any plausible interpretation of the Law on Media to support their finding that accreditation was a “requirement”, and remained completely silent as to the applicant’s relevant objections and arguments in that regard.", "para_idx": 96}, {"section": "merits", "text": "55.  The Court notes that only the Supreme Court, in its decision of 16 February 2017 in the follow-up proceedings (see paragraph 20 above), attempted to provide some form of extended legal reasoning. However, like the other courts, it provided no clear legal basis for its brief finding that foreign media outlets and their representatives were “required” to be accredited with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in order to operate in the country, a finding which, as discussed above, was unsupported by the straightforward textual interpretation of the Law on Media. It then merely proceeded to state at more length that engaging in journalistic activity without such accreditation did not, by itself, entail criminal liability and that such activity constituted illegal entrepreneurship if, in addition, it caused significant or large public damage or generated a significant or large amount of income. The applicant’s income during the relevant period exceeded the “significant amount” threshold. The entirety of the applicant’s income as a journalist during the relevant period was taken into account as income generated through illegal entrepreneurship for the sole reason that she had no accreditation during that period, whereas there was no clear legal basis to hold that such accreditation was at all required in her situation. The Court notes that such circular reasoning by the Supreme Court is incompatible with Article 7 of the Convention.", "para_idx": 97}, {"section": "merits", "text": "56.  Having regard to the above, the Court considers that, in the determination of the criminal charge against the applicant of the offence of illegal entrepreneurship, the provisions of Article 192 of the Criminal Code and the relevant provisions of the Law on Media, as in force at the relevant time, were extensively and unforeseeably construed to her detriment, in a manner which could not be said to have constituted a development consistent with the essence of the offence (compare, mutatis mutandis, Navalnyye v. Russia, no. 101/15, § 68, 17 October 2017). Even as a professional journalist who could seek appropriate legal advice, it would have been difficult – if not impossible – for the applicant to have foreseen that the domestic law would be applied to her situation in such an arbitrary manner and to have known that her work as a freelance journalist with both domestic and foreign media without accreditation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs could result in a criminal sanction.", "para_idx": 98}, {"section": "merits", "text": "57.  Accordingly, there has been a violation of Article 7 of the Convention as regards the applicant’s conviction for the offence of illegal entrepreneurship.", "para_idx": 99}, {"section": "merits", "text": "58.  The applicant complained that the domestic courts had delivered unreasoned judgments, in breach of the requirements of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, which reads as follows:", "para_idx": 100}, {"section": "merits", "text": "“In the determination ... of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by [a] ... tribunal ...”", "para_idx": 101}, {"section": "merits", "text": "59.  The Court notes that this complaint is neither manifestly ill-founded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in Article 35 of the Convention.

The Court concluded in that judgment that, contrary to Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention, the material put before it did not meet the minimum standard for the reasonableness of a suspicion required for an individual’s arrest and continued detention (ibid., §§ 83-84). In breach of the requirements of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention, the domestic courts in that case failed to verify the existence of a reasonable suspicion underpinning the applicant’s arrest and detention despite her repeated complaints to that end and, by using vague and standard wording, automatically endorsed the prosecution’s applications without any genuine and independent review of the “lawfulness” of her detention (ibid., § 91). Having also had regard to the combination of case-specific facts, the Court found that, contrary to the requirements of Article 18 of the Convention, the authorities’ actions had been driven by improper reasons: the actual purpose of the impugned measures was to silence and to punish the applicant for her journalistic activities (ibid., §§ 114-20).", "para_idx": 107}, {"section": "merits", "text": "65.  The scope of the Khadija Ismayilova (no. 2) judgment (cited above) was limited, inter alia, to the issues of compatibility with Articles 5 §§ 1 (c) and 4 and Article 18 of the Convention of the applicant’s detention during the pre-trial stage of the proceedings. In the present case, however, the Court is called upon to examine a different set of legal issues – namely, whether the criminal proceedings against the applicant as a whole were fair, as required by Article 6 of the Convention.", "para_idx": 108}, {"section": "merits", "text": "66.  While the issues to be examined and the legal standards applicable under Article 6 of the Convention are different, both the previous case and the present case concern the same criminal proceedings against the applicant involving the same charges stemming from the same events. Although the applicant was eventually acquitted of the offences of incitement to suicide, embezzlement and abuse of power under Articles 125, 179.3.2 and 308.2 of the Criminal Code, she was ultimately convicted of the offences of illegal entrepreneurship under Article 192.2.2 (later re‑classified under Article 192.1) and tax evasion under Article 213.1 of the Criminal Code. As the Court held in the Khadija Ismayilova (no. 2) judgment (cited above), during the pre-trial stage of the proceedings, those accusations against the applicant had also suffered from a prima facie lack of plausibility calling for a high level of scrutiny of the facts. The circumstances on which this previous finding of the Court was based remain unchanged in the present case as regards the charges of illegal entrepreneurship and tax evasion. The Court will therefore proceed with analysing under Article 6 whether this deficiency has been compensated by the evidence presented at the trial and the reasons provided by the domestic courts (compare Ilgar Mammadov (no. 2), cited above, § 203).", "para_idx": 109}, {"section": "merits", "text": "67.  Turning to the present case, the Court firstly refers to its analysis and findings in paragraphs 49-57 above in respect of the applicant’s conviction for the offence of illegal entrepreneurship and considers that they are equally relevant for the present complaint. In particular, the applicant raised before the domestic courts strong, pertinent and well-founded objections that the acts attributed to her had not fallen within the scope of the criminal offence of illegal entrepreneurship. An adequate examination of those objections would be decisive for the outcome of the case and, therefore, those arguments required a specific and express reply from the domestic courts. However, as the Court found above, the domestic courts did not provide any adequate response to them in their judgments, instead relying on very brief and manifestly arbitrary reasoning.", "para_idx": 110}, {"section": "merits", "text": "68.  As regards the charge of tax evasion, the situation was very similar. The conviction under that charge was mainly based on two reports, which the applicant argued had been vague, unclear as to what had been meant by their conclusions and compiled in a manner which had not been compliant with the relevant domestic law. She further argued that Azadliq Radio was a non-commercial organisation which did not engage in business activities and was not liable to pay profit tax. She also argued that the manner in which the amount of “profit” had been determined and the profit tax calculated had been erroneous in view of the fact that Azadliq Radio had only received funds from its parent entity for the purpose of covering the necessary operational expenses. She also maintained that her particular role as the head of the Baku bureau of Azadliq Radio during the relevant period had not involved any responsibility for financial matters or payment of taxes and social contributions. In the Court’s view, the applicant’s arguments objecting to the charge of tax evasion were pertinent, strong and capable of influencing the outcome of the case if properly assessed. However, again the domestic courts either remained completely silent in respect of those arguments or dismissed them in a very general, stereotypically worded manner.

In order to answer that question, the scope of the measure must be determined by putting it in the context of the facts of the case and of the relevant legislation (see Wille v. Liechtenstein [GC], no. 28396/95, § 43, ECHR 1999-VII; Miroslava Todorova v. Bulgaria, no. 40072/13, § 153, 19 October 2021; and Selishcheva and Others v. Russia, nos. 39056/22 and 9 others, § 41, 27 May 2025). Having regard to the facts of the present case and the nature of the allegations made, the Court considers that this issue should be examined in the light of the general principles emerging from its case-law on the assessment of evidence. It reiterates in this connection that in assessing evidence, it has adopted the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt”. However, it has never been its purpose to borrow the approach of the national legal systems which use that standard. The Court’s role is not to rule on criminal guilt or civil liability but on Contracting States’ responsibility under the Convention. The specificity of its task under Article 19 of the Convention – to ensure the observance by the Contracting States of their engagement to secure the fundamental rights enshrined in the Convention – conditions its approach to the issues of evidence and proof. The Court adopts those conclusions that are, in its view, supported by the free evaluation of all evidence, including such inferences as may flow from the facts in their entirety and from the parties’ submissions. According to its established case‑law, proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Nachova and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], nos. 43577/98 and 43579/98, § 147, ECHR 2005-VII). It has been the Court’s practice to allow flexibility in this respect, taking into consideration the nature of the substantive right at stake and any evidentiary difficulties involved. In certain instances, only the Government have access to information capable of corroborating or refuting the applicant’s allegations; consequently, a rigorous application of the principle affirmanti, non neganti, incumbit probatio is impossible. Although these principles have mainly been applied in the context of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, the Court observes that there are examples in which they have been applied in respect of other Convention rights, including Article 10 of the Convention (see Baka v. Hungary [GC], no. 20261/12, § 143, 23 June 2016, with further references).", "para_idx": 125}, {"section": "merits", "text": "79.  These principles are particularly relevant in the present case, where no domestic court ever examined the applicant’s allegations that she had been targeted because of the content of her publications. It is against this background that the Court considers that the facts of the case and the sequence of events have to be assessed and considered “in their entirety” (compare Ivanova v. Bulgaria, no. 52435/99, §§ 83-84, 12 April 2007, and Baka, cited above, §§ 145-48).", "para_idx": 126}, {"section": "merits", "text": "80.  The Court notes at the outset that at least one of the charges on which the applicant was ultimately convicted directly concerned the modalities of her exercise of the journalistic profession. Thus, her conviction for “illegal entrepreneurship” was based on the charge that she had carried out journalistic activities as a “representative of foreign media” without obtaining the relevant accreditation. However, the applicant is an Azerbaijani journalist with a long record of reporting within the country.  Such accreditation requirements, where they seek to regulate access to the profession or the terms under which journalistic work may be lawfully carried out, constitute “formalities” or “conditions” within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 10 of the Convention. Therefore, restrictions or penalties imposed for non-compliance with such conditions, even if formally presented as economic or administrative in nature, amount in principle to an interference with a journalist’s ability to receive and impart information and ideas (see, mutatis mutandis, Mándli and Others v. Hungary, no. 63164/16, § 45, 26 May 2020; Gafiuc v. Romania, no. 59174/13, § 55, 13 October 2020). As such, the applicant’s conviction for “illegal entrepreneurship” did not have a merely incidental impact on her journalistic activity. It was related to her very ability to freely exercise her profession and amounted therefore to an interference with her rights under Article 10 of the Convention, irrespective of whether the criminal proceedings were pursued with an ulterior purpose.", "para_idx": 127}, {"section": "merits", "text": "81.  The Court furthermore deems it necessary to note the sequence of events in the present case.

Azerbaijan, nos. 65286/13 and 57270/14, §§ 6-8, 10 January 2019, and Khadija Ismayilova (no. 2), cited above, § 11).

The Court examined the applicant’s complaints relating to those events from the standpoint of the respondent State’s positive obligations under Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention (ibid., §§ 83-132 and 151-66). It nevertheless emphasised that, while the identity of those who breached the applicant’s privacy was unknown, it “[had] concerns as regards the answer” to the “open” question whether those responsible were linked to State agents abusing their official power, in view of the applicant’s credible allegations in this regard, the contextual information provided by the third-party interveners in that case and the careful planning and execution of the covert surveillance operation (ibid., § 113). In addition, the Court also found that the respondent State had breached its negative obligation under Article 8 of the Convention through the public disclosure, by the investigating authorities, of an excessive amount of the applicant’s personal information obtained during the investigation, thereby further compounding the existing breach of the applicant’s privacy (ibid., §§ 133-50).", "para_idx": 129}, {"section": "merits", "text": "83.  Moreover, during this time period, numerous articles about the applicant and other civil society activists and human rights defenders were published in the State media and in the media allegedly close to the government.

Two days before the applicant’s arrest, on 3 December 2014, State-owned news agencies published a sixty-page manifesto written by R.M., the then head of the President’s Office, in which, among other statements, he targeted the applicant personally by accusing her of spreading false information and engaging in activities “tantamount to working for foreign secret services” and treason (for the full quote, see Khadija Ismayilova (no. 2), cited above, § 15).", "para_idx": 130}, {"section": "merits", "text": "84.  In the context of the criminal case against the applicant, which was the subject of the Khadija Ismayilova (no. 2) judgment and the present case, the applicant was initially arrested on 5 December 2014 on the charge of incitement to suicide. Additional charges – embezzlement, illegal entrepreneurship, tax evasion, and abuse of power – were brought against her at a later stage (ibid., §§ 21-22 and 36). As noted above, in addition to the other findings, the Court found in the Khadija Ismayilova (no. 2) judgment that, contrary to Article 5 § 1 of the Convention, the applicant had been deprived of her liberty in the absence of a “reasonable suspicion” that she had committed a criminal offence (ibid., §§ 67-84). Moreover, it found that, contrary to the requirements of Article 18 of the Convention, the restriction of the applicant’s liberty had been imposed for a purpose other than prescribed by Article 5 § 1 (c) of the Convention, namely to silence and to punish her for her journalistic activities (ibid., §§ 114‑20).", "para_idx": 131}, {"section": "merits", "text": "85.  As previously stated, the present case concerns the entirety of the same criminal proceedings, including the trial stage. Although the applicant was ultimately acquitted of the charges of incitement to suicide, embezzlement and abuse of power, she was convicted of the offences of illegal entrepreneurship and tax evasion. As the Court has found above, the domestic courts’ judgments convicting the applicant were fundamentally flawed and marked by arbitrariness (see paragraphs 67-70 above). The Court reiterates that the domestic courts failed to address a number of strong, pertinent and well‑founded arguments raised by the applicant, including her submissions that the charges against her had been fabricated with the aim of interfering with the exercise of her right to freedom of expression.", "para_idx": 132}, {"section": "merits", "text": "86.  The Court also points out that in a series of cases concerning Azerbaijan it has noted a pattern of arbitrary arrest, detention or other measures taken in respect of government critics, civil society activists and human rights defenders, all occurring approximately during the same time period as the criminal proceedings against the applicant (see, inter alia, Rasul Jafarov, cited above, §§ 159-61; Mammadli v. Azerbaijan, no. 47145/14, §§ 99-101, 19 April 2018; Aliyev v. Azerbaijan, nos. 68762/14 and 71200/14, § 223, 20 September 2018; Rashad Hasanov and Others v.

Once there is prima facie evidence in favour of the applicant’s version of the events and the existence of a causal link, the burden of proof should shift to the Government.

In retaliation for her journalistic activity, the authorities chose to initiate criminal proceedings against the applicant on a number of criminal charges and ultimately convicted her of the offences of illegal entrepreneurship and tax evasion. The Court considers that such interference with the applicant’s freedom of expression was not only unlawful but also grossly arbitrary and incompatible with the principle of the rule of law, which is expressly mentioned in the Preamble to the Convention and is inherent in all its Articles (see, mutatis mutandis, Baka, cited above, § 117; compare also Ibrahimov and Mammadov, cited above, § 173).

According to the Court’s case-law, separate examination of a complaint under that Article was only warranted if the claim that a restriction had been applied for a purpose not prescribed by the Convention appeared to be a fundamental aspect of the case.

The Court has found above that the criminal proceedings against the applicant, resulting in her ultimate conviction for the criminal offences of illegal entrepreneurship and tax evasion, amounted to an unjustified interference with her right to freedom of expression, in violation of Article 10 of the Convention (see paragraphs 88-91 above). Accordingly, the scope of the present complaint under Article 18 differs from that examined in Khadija Ismayilova (no. 2) in that, in addition to having been raised in conjunction with a different Convention provision, it relates not only to the applicant’s pre-trial detention in the framework of those proceedings, but to the entirety of the criminal proceedings against her, which is to be seen as a continuation of the events that were the subject of the Court’s examination in Khadija Ismayilova (no. 2).", "para_idx": 155}, {"section": "merits", "text": "106.  As the Court has found above, the criminal proceedings against the applicant resulting in her conviction constituted an interference with her right to freedom of expression, which was unlawful and did not pursue any legitimate aims set out in Article 10.

In this connection, the Court notes that the applicant’s submissions concerning the complaints under Articles 10 and 18 of the Convention were indeed substantially similar in essence (see paragraphs 73-76 and 94-98 above). However, in view of the particular circumstances of the present case, as discussed in paragraphs 81‑86 above, it nevertheless considers that the applicant’s complaint under Article 18 of the Convention represents a distinct and fundamental aspect of the case (contrast Razvozzhayev v.

The Court considers that all of these factors are equally relevant to the present complaint. Moreover, the manner in which the criminal proceedings against the applicant unfolded – being marred by a significant degree of arbitrariness and by the domestic courts’ failure to adequately examine the applicant’s strong, pertinent and well-founded arguments (see paragraphs 67-69 above) – indicates that the ulterior purpose evident at the initial stages of the proceedings remained unchanged throughout their entirety.", "para_idx": 158}, {"section": "merits", "text": "109.  In this latter respect, the Court recalls that in a system governed by the rule of law, judicial review represents the ultimate safeguard for the fundamental rights of individuals and their protection from abuse of power.

An assessment of whether this minimum has been attained depends on many factors, including the nature and context of the treatment, its duration, its physical and mental effects and, in some instances, the sex of the victim and the relationship between the victim and the author of the treatment. Even in the absence of actual bodily harm or intense physical or mental suffering, treatment which humiliates or debases an individual, showing a lack of respect for or diminishing his or her human dignity, or which arouses feelings of fear, anguish or inferiority capable of breaking an individual’s moral and physical resistance, may be characterised as degrading and also fall within the prohibition set forth in Article 3.

Belgium [GC], no. 23380/09, §§ 86-87, ECHR 2015, and Volodina v. Russia, no. 41261/17, § 73, 9 July 2019).", "para_idx": 57}, {"section": "merits", "text": "37.  The obligation of the High Contracting Parties under Article 1 of the Convention to secure for everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in the Convention, taken together with Article 3, requires States to take measures designed to ensure that individuals within their jurisdiction are not subjected to ill-treatment, including ill-treatment administered by private individuals (see, among many other authorities, M.C. v. Bulgaria, no. 39272/98, § 149, ECHR 2003‑XII, and O’Keeffe v. Ireland [GC], no. 35810/09, § 144, ECHR 2014 (extracts)). Furthermore, the absence of any direct State responsibility for acts of violence of such severity as to engage Article 3 of the Convention does not absolve the State from all obligations under this provision. In such cases, Article 3 requires that the authorities conduct an effective official investigation into the alleged ill-treatment, even if such treatment has been inflicted by private individuals (see M.C. v. Bulgaria, cited above, § 151; Denis Vasilyev v. Russia, no. 32704/04, §§ 98-99, 17 December 2009; and M.C. and A.C. v.

The authorities must take all reasonable steps to secure evidence concerning the incident, including forensic evidence. Special diligence is required in dealing with domestic violence cases, and the specific nature of the domestic violence must be taken into account in the course of the domestic proceedings. The State’s obligation to investigate will not be satisfied if the protection afforded by domestic law exists only in theory; above all, it must also operate effectively in practice, and that requires a prompt examination of the case without unnecessary delays. The effectiveness principle means that the domestic judicial authorities must on no account be prepared to let the physical or psychological suffering inflicted go unpunished.

In this respect the Court has already held that the protection mechanisms available under domestic law should operate in practice in a manner that allows for the examination of the merits of a particular case within a reasonable time (see, for example, W. v. Slovenia, no. 24125/06, § 65, 23 January 2014, and M.C. and A.C. v.

The prosecutor had found those statements serious enough to warrant T.’s indictment for abuse by a person close to the victim committed in a serious manner within the meaning of Article 208 §§ 1 (a) and 2 (d) of the Criminal Code (see paragraph 22 above) and had noted that they had been corroborated by several witness statements, an expert report, medical reports and the criminal order of 8 December 2014 (see paragraph 11 above).", "para_idx": 65}, {"section": "merits", "text": "43.  The Court notes that no medical reports were submitted to it by the parties and that the applicant stated before the trial court that, out of fear, she had never sought medical assistance (see paragraph 12 above).

Having regard to its case-law (see paragraphs 36-37 above), the Court finds that such treatment may be regarded as “degrading”.

Generally speaking, the first two aspects of these positive obligations are classified as “substantive”, while the third aspect corresponds to the State’s positive “procedural” obligation (see X and Others v. Bulgaria [GC], no. 22457/16, § 178, 2 February 2021; Kurt v.

In this connection, the Court notes that the applicant herself neither lodged a complaint with the police nor requested protection measures. Nevertheless, it appears from the material in the case file that, as soon as the domestic authorities became aware of the violence to which she had been subjected at the hands of her then husband on 5 July 2014, they brought criminal proceedings against the latter, which resulted in his conviction in December 2014 (see paragraph 5 above). In the meantime, in September 2014, the police started, on their own initiative, a new criminal investigation into T.’s behaviour up until July 2014 (see paragraph 6 above), the effectiveness of which is the subject of the present application, and when T. was released from prison, in March 2015, the judge adopted a restraining order prohibiting him from contacting or approaching the applicant (see paragraph 9 above). The applicant did not assert that T. had continued his abusive behaviour towards her after the application of those measures.

It is not called to consider whether the national courts properly assessed the relevant facts; it cannot act as a domestic criminal court or hear appeals against the decisions of national courts, and it is not for it to pronounce on any points of criminal liability (see Vučković, § 59, and Hasmik Khachatryan, § 197, both cited above). Nonetheless, where allegations are made under Article 3 of the Convention, the Court must apply a particularly thorough scrutiny, even if certain domestic proceedings and investigations have already taken place (see Y. v. Slovenia, no. 41107/10, § 96, ECHR 2015 (extracts), and A and B v.

However, this finding appears to be in stark contrast to the abundant evidence supporting the charges against T., which the courts disregarded without any explanation of their reasons for so doing. In the first place, there were the statements of the applicant’s children, interviewed in the pre-trial proceedings (see paragraph 11 above), who spoke about their father’s violent behaviour which they had witnessed and to which they had also been exposed (see paragraphs 12 and 18 above). Furthermore, the applicant’s statements appear to have been corroborated by several witnesses, among them her relatives and neighbours, her mother and sister, T.’s father and her treating psychiatrist, who had seen her injuries.", "para_idx": 79}, {"section": "merits", "text": "56.  The Court further observes that the psychological expert found that the applicant suffered from battered woman syndrome and post-traumatic stress disorder and he also found that there was no reason to doubt that the applicant had been exposed to situations of violence. Nevertheless, and although the expert explained that the psychiatric treatment undergone by the applicant in 2010 had had no link to the above-mentioned syndrome (see paragraph 12 above), which had obviously developed later, the trial court held – rather arbitrarily, in the Court’s view – that the fact that the applicant had been consulting a psychiatrist as of 2010 had cast doubt on the expert’s statement that her issues had been linked to her conflicts with T. after September 2012 (see paragraph 18 above). It appears all the more striking that the trial court considered that expert opinion refuted by the statements of the children’s teachers, which had nothing to do with the applicant herself. Moreover, the trial court also disregarded the experts’ findings that T. was emotionally unstable, inclined to aggressive reactions and dependent on alcohol, and remained silent in respect of the fact that the applicant had expressed fear of him.", "para_idx": 80}, {"section": "merits", "text": "57.  The Court cannot but observe that, despite this extensive evidence corroborating the applicant’s statements, the trial court put emphasis on the rather scant testimony of the witnesses who had stated that they had not known about the events described in the indictment. Moreover, the court did not explain why the fact that T. had admitted to having occasionally slapped the applicant and harassed her verbally was not taken as a factor counting against him, at least for a lesser offence of behaving in a dangerous and threatening manner as indicated by the appellate court in its second judgment (see paragraph 17 in fine above), but rather as a ground for dismissing the charges on account of the reciprocal character of the spouses’ violent behaviour. Therefore, while accepting that there had been violence, the court relied on its alleged reciprocity to exclude its criminal character (see paragraph 18 in fine above), thereby demonstrating the lack of a gender-sensitive approach in the present case.", "para_idx": 81}, {"section": "merits", "text": "58.  The Court therefore considers that while the first-instance court described all the evidence in detail, it was overly formalistic in reaching its conclusions and showed no awareness of particular features of domestic violence cases, failing to analyse the circumstances of the case from a gender-based violence perspective and to make a context-sensitive assessment of the credibility of the various statements (see, mutatis mutandis, C. v. Romania, no. 47358/20, §§ 79-80, 30 August 2022, and X. v. Greece, no. 38588/21, §§ 79 and 87, 13 February 2024). In particular, the applicant’s statements do not appear to have been placed in a relevant context, specifically with regard to other witness evidence corroborating her version of events and the expert evidence (see, mutatis mutandis, A.P. v. the Republic of Moldova, no. 41086/12, § 31, 26 October 2021), and the context-based elements, such as the history, the continuous pattern and the dynamics of T.’s violence against the applicant, determined in the criminal order of 8 December 2014, were entirely disregarded.", "para_idx": 82}, {"section": "merits", "text": "59.  As to the latter point, the Court acknowledges that each criminal case should be decided on the basis of the facts that either confirm or refute the charges. It considers, however, that in domestic-violence cases, failure to address interrelated incidents that fall under the same pattern of aggressive behaviour amounts to a disregard of the obligation to submit those cases to the careful scrutiny required of the domestic courts under the Convention (see paragraph 41 above).", "para_idx": 83}, {"section": "merits", "text": "60.  Lastly, the Court reiterates that, when examining the effectiveness of an investigation under Article 3, it also takes into account the promptness of the proceedings, a requirement which should be examined together with other parameters affecting the (in)effectiveness of the investigation. The Court takes into consideration not only the overall length of proceedings, but also whether decisions have been repeatedly declared void on account of omissions by lower courts (see Kosteckas v. Lithuania, no. 960/13, § 41, 13 June 2017; D.M.D. v. Romania, no. 23022/13, §§ 43-44, 3 October 2017; and Y. v.

On the whole, the proceedings before the domestic courts lasted more than seven years, exposing the applicant to a prolonged state of uncertainty and other negative implications of the lengthy proceedings. In particular, she had to relive the painful events a number of times during three retrials, which must have caused her unnecessary suffering and frustration, and which might have been avoided had the criminal-law mechanisms which were aimed at deterrence of and punishment for criminal acts of abuse been applied in an effective and prompt manner.", "para_idx": 86}, {"section": "merits", "text": "63.  In sum, the Court finds that the manner in which the authorities actually handled the matter – notably the serious shortcomings described above, that is, the failure to conduct a context-sensitive assessment of the case and the slow pace of the criminal proceedings against T. – disclosed a failure on their part to discharge their positive obligations under Article 3 of the Convention.", "para_idx": 87}, {"section": "merits", "text": "64.  The foregoing considerations are sufficient to enable the Court to conclude that there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention.", "para_idx": 88}, {"section": "merits", "text": "65.  The applicant complained that the domestic violence of which she had been a victim had interfered with her right to respect for private life under Article 8 of the Convention because the State had failed to ensure an effective investigation and to provide her with effective protection from the violence perpetrated against her.

She submitted that the cases of violence against women were underreported and the number of prosecutions and convictions of perpetrators was low, as indicated in reports on Slovakia (which she did not specify) by the CEDAW Committee and the CAT and as illustrated by several past cases of violence against women which had not been sufficiently investigated (here she referred to Kontrová v.

Turkey, no. 33401/02, § 191, ECHR 2009). The Court has previously held that the general and discriminatory judicial passivity of the police, creating a climate that was conducive to domestic violence, amounted to a violation of Article 14 of the Convention (ibid., §§ 191 et seq.). It also found that such discriminatory treatment had occurred where it could be established that the authorities’ actions had not been a simple failure or delay in dealing with the violence in question, but had amounted to repeatedly condoning such violence and had reflected a discriminatory attitude towards the complainant as a woman (see Eremia, cited above, § 89, and Talpis v. Italy, no. 41237/14, § 141, 2 March 2017). However, the Court’s findings made in the present case under Article 3 of the Convention do not disclose a discriminatory attitude on the part of the authorities and do not allow it to conclude that the Slovak police or other national authorities are consistently downplaying or unwilling to deal with cases of violence against women.", "para_idx": 94}, {"section": "merits", "text": "71.  In this connection, the Court takes note that Slovakia has not, to date, ratified the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (“the Istanbul Convention”).

Furthermore, in its Concluding observations on the fourth periodic report of Slovakia of 7 June 2023, the CAT recommended that Slovakia should ensure that all acts of gender-based and domestic violence be thoroughly investigated and that the alleged perpetrators prosecuted and, if convicted, adequately punished (see paragraph 27 above).", "para_idx": 95}, {"section": "merits", "text": "72.  The Court notes, however, that in the present case the applicant only generally referred to unspecified reports by the CEDAW Committee and the CAT, without providing any statistical or other information disclosing an appearance of discriminatory treatment on the part of the Slovak authorities of women who are victims of domestic violence.

Iceland, no. 59813/19, § 98, 26 August 2025).

Instead, he relied on the right to have his individual independence respected and safeguarded as well as the procedural right of access to a court in case of arbitrary changes to his professional situation, which in his case concerned a transfer to another division within the District Court.

In that context, the applicant submitted that he had never contested the need for court presidents to undertake administrative or managerial decisions aimed at ensuring the proper administration of justice, and argued that those decisions, in so far as they pertained to the assigning of judicial duties to individual judges, should be subject to strict review by an independent court. Such review should take into account the observance of procedural rules in order to exclude arbitrariness and any lack of compliance with applicable laws. Against that background, the applicant argued that, in his view, the Government had not only failed to demonstrate any objective reasons which would justify the exclusion of judicial review but, on the contrary, that the following circumstances of his case reinforced the necessity of guaranteeing him the right to a court: (i) the arbitrary appointment of the President of the District Court by the Minister of Justice, (ii) violations of procedure regarding the decision on the applicant’s transfer, and (iii) the examination of his appeal by the recomposed NCJ also being in breach of the applicable laws and the principles of fairness and independence.", "para_idx": 105}, {"section": "admissibility", "text": "(iii)   Further submissions from the parties", "para_idx": 106}, {"section": "admissibility", "text": "54.  In his additional submissions, the applicant relied on what he deemed to be newly discovered factual information regarding his case, namely press articles published on 17 May 2022 which reported that, back in 2019, judges with links to the Ministry of Justice discussed the applicant’s case in a group chat on a messaging application.

Instead, he relied upon the right to respect for and protection of his individual independence, as well as his procedural right of access to a court to challenge any arbitrary changes to his professional situation. The Court further notes that, in his appeal lodged with the NCJ (see paragraph 18 above), the applicant expressly complained that the transfer decision had infringed his judicial independence and the prohibition of the arbitrary transfer of a judge from one division to another.", "para_idx": 117}, {"section": "merits", "text": "61.  The case therefore concerns, from the standpoint of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, a member of the judiciary’s right of access to a court and his right to a fair procedure in order to complain about the legitimacy of his non-consensual transfer between different divisions of the same court, which affected the conditions of his employment (compare with Bilgen, cited above, § 57). Thus, in the determination of whether the applicant could arguably rely on a “right” so as to bring into play the applicability of Article 6 of the Convention, the issue is not whether a right to a guarantee of jurisdictional specialisation existed in the Polish legal system, but whether there is an arguable basis on which one could claim a right to be protected against an arbitrary transfer between two divisions of one court, each dealing with a different area of law (ibid.).", "para_idx": 118}, {"section": "merits", "text": "62.  The Court has on many occasions emphasised the special role in society of the judiciary which, as the guarantor of justice, a fundamental value in a State governed by the rule of law, must enjoy public confidence if it is to be successful in carrying out its duties (see Baka, cited above, § 165, with further references). It has similarly already found no reason why this consideration should not also be applied in cases concerning the right of access to a court for members of the judiciary in matters concerning their status or career (see Bilgen, cited above, § 58). Given the prominent place that the judiciary occupies among State organs in a democratic society and the growing importance attached to the separation of powers and to the necessity of safeguarding the independence of the judiciary (see Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e Sá v. Portugal [GC], nos. 55391/13 and 2 others, § 196, 6 November 2018), the Court must be particularly attentive to the protection of members of the judiciary against measures affecting their status or career that can threaten their judicial independence and autonomy (see Bilgen, cited above, § 58).", "para_idx": 119}, {"section": "merits", "text": "63.  Turning to the provisions of domestic law, the Court notes that Article 180 of the Polish Constitution provides for the principle of irremovability of judges. In particular, the second paragraph of that constitutional provision specifically states that “dismissal of a judge from office, suspension from office, or transfer to another court or position against his or her will, may only occur by virtue of a court judgment and only in those instances prescribed by statute”. While it is not for this Court to determine whether assigning a judge against his or her will to another division of the same court should be considered a ”transfer to another position” under that provision of the Constitution, it notes that the principles of independence of the judiciary (stemming directly from Article 173 of the Constitution) and the security of tenure of judges (as guaranteed in the above-cited Article 180 thereof) are well-rooted in domestic law. With that being stated, the Court further notes that the Constitution provides that the Republic of Poland is a democratic State governed by the rule of law (Article 2), with organs of public authority functioning on the basis of, and within the limits of, the law (Article 7). Finally, the Constitution provides (in Article 77 § 2) that “statutes may not bar the recourse by any person to the courts in pursuit of claims alleging infringement of freedoms or rights”.", "para_idx": 120}, {"section": "merits", "text": "64.  In that connection, the Court finds important the provisions of the 2001 Act in so far as they regulate the attribution of duties to judges, and in particular the assignment of judges to divisions (see paragraphs 37-41 above). At the outset, the Court notes with concern that the 2018 amendments to the 2001 Act (see paragraphs 38-41 above) appear to have extended the powers of court presidents (which had been considered extensive in the relevant Venice Commission opinion even before the adoption of the amendments – see paragraph 47 above), while also limiting the rights of judges affected by their decisions, notably as regards the right to appeal in general and the specific procedural rights within the modified appellate procedure (see paragraphs 40-41 above).", "para_idx": 121}, {"section": "merits", "text": "65.  With the above being stated, the Court emphasises that even in the amended version, applicable to the applicant’s situation, the 2001 Act still required, as a general rule, that a transfer between divisions be made with consent of the judge concerned (Section 22a (4a) of the 2001 Act). It was only in limited circumstances, that a transfer without consent was allowed. In that respect, the Court notes with concern the circumstances cited by the Polish Commissioner for Human Rights in his letter to the President of the District Court (see paragraph 21 above) in so far as it appeared that an experienced judge of the Family Division had been transferred, against her will, to the Civil Division of the same court, thus presumably creating a vacancy to be filled by the applicant’s transfer.", "para_idx": 122}, {"section": "merits", "text": "66.  When the above provisions are read in the light of the constitutional guarantees mentioned above, it cannot be argued that the President of the District Court had unfettered discretion in the matter of transfer of judges so as to allow him to transfer the applicant against his will and without providing any reasons (see paragraph 16 above). The Court notes, in this respect, the applicant’s argument as observed by the Commissioner for Human Rights (see paragraph 21 above), that the applicant had not been the judge with the shortest duration of service in his original division and that, therefore, no proper consideration was given to that fact when deciding on the applicant’s transfer, as required by Section 22a(4c) of the 2001 Act. The Court finds that, on this basis and in the absence of written reasons addressing that issue, the applicant, whose performance and conduct were not called into question, could argue that his transfer was not in compliance with the provisions of domestic law (compare with Bilgen, cited above, § 61).", "para_idx": 123}, {"section": "merits", "text": "67.  Against that background, the Court reiterates that it has previously recognised a right, supported by international norms, of a member of the judiciary to protection against an arbitrary transfer (see Bilgen, cited above, § 63), albeit between two distinct courts. Therefore, it remains to be seen whether that right may cover transfers between two divisions of the same court.", "para_idx": 124}, {"section": "merits", "text": "68.  In that respect, the Court fully agrees with the findings of the CJEU, made in the latter’s judgment of 6 October 2021 (in the case of W.Ż. (Chamber of Extraordinary Control and Public Affairs of the Supreme Court – Appointment); see paragraphs 48-50 above), that a transfer of a judge, without his or her consent, between two divisions of the same court, is potentially capable of undermining the principles of the irremovability of judges and judicial independence.", "para_idx": 125}, {"section": "merits", "text": "69.  The present case concerns the applicant’s involuntary transfer from one division of a court to another division of that court, each dealing with a different area of law. Referring to both, its own findings in Bilgen (cited above, § 63), as well as those of the CJEU in the case cited above, the Court considers that the protection of judicial independence requires that the same level of safeguards against involuntary transfers of members of the judiciary apply to transfers between two divisions of the same court dealing with a different area of law and to transfers between distinct courts.", "para_idx": 126}, {"section": "merits", "text": "70.  That being said, the Court emphasises that the case under review concerns a transfer between two divisions of the same court competent to hear cases within different areas of law, and that the case of W.Ż. (as referred to in paragraphs 48-50 above) concerned a transfer between two divisions of the same court competent to hear cases within the same area of law but on different levels of jurisdiction. The Court notes, by contrast, that in the specific context of the Polish judiciary it is also possible to transfer judges between two divisions of the same court which, while being distinct on an organisational level, are competent to hear cases within the same area of law and at the same level of jurisdiction. In such case, while it is not the Court’s task to examine the question of involuntary transfers of judges in the abstract, the Court recognises that the level of safeguards discussed in paragraph 69 above might not be required. In that context, the Court finds it relevant to reiterate that it has already found that Article 6 of the Convention did not apply to a temporary secondment of a magistrate without a significant change in the nature of his or her tasks and functions (see Vanchev v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 28003/15, §§ 35-37, 30 January 2024).", "para_idx": 127}, {"section": "merits", "text": "71.  Turning to the circumstances of the instant case, the Court notes that the applicant, who previously adjudicated in a Criminal Division of the District Court, was transferred – against his will – to the Family Division of that court, which resulted in him hearing cases in a different area of law.", "para_idx": 128}, {"section": "merits", "text": "72.  Nevertheless, in order for the applicant to be able to rely on the right to protection against arbitrary transfer, the Court must first determine whether, in the specific circumstances of the instant case, he could legitimately suspect that there was an element of arbitrariness in his transfer, since only such legitimate suspicion could provide an arguable basis on which the right to be protected against arbitrary transfer could be claimed (see Bilgen, cited above, § 61).", "para_idx": 129}, {"section": "merits", "text": "73.  In that respect, the Court deems the following circumstances relied upon by the applicant to be noteworthy. First, the applicant gave rulings in several cases which attracted public attention as well as criticism from the representatives of the then Government (see paragraphs 8-9 above). Second, the President of the District Court at the relevant time had served, before his appointment to that post, as a seconded judge in the Ministry of Justice under Minister of Justice Z. Ziobro (see paragraph 10 above) who abolished the Criminal Division XI of the relevant District Court (see paragraph 12 above). Third, the President of the District Court proceeded with the transfer notwithstanding the fact that the Board of the Warsaw Regional Court had postponed giving its opinion on the transfer request (see paragraph 15 above). Fourth, the Commissioner for Human Rights raised valid concerns regarding the circumstances of the transfer in his letter to the President of the District Court, to which he did not receive a response which could be deemed to have duly addressed those concerns (see paragraphs 21, and 51-52 above).", "para_idx": 130}, {"section": "merits", "text": "74.  The Court considers that in view of the combined circumstances listed above, the applicant could legitimately suspect an element of arbitrariness in his transfer at the relevant time.

The Court reiterates that the Eskelinen test, aimed at determining the nature of the right at stake, comprises two cumulative conditions which have to be met for the State to rely before the Court on an applicant’s status as a civil servant to exclude the protection embodied in Article 6: (i) the State in its national law must have excluded access to a court; and (ii) the exclusion must be justified on objective grounds in the State’s interest (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others, cited above, § 62 and also Grzęda, cited above, § 292).", "para_idx": 135}, {"section": "merits", "text": "78.  The Court notes that the parties agreed that the domestic law as applicable at the relevant time expressly excluded judicial review of decisions concerning the involuntary transfer of a judge between divisions of the same court, and that – consequently – the first condition of the Eskelinen test was met.

It is for the respondent Government to show that the subject matter of the dispute in issue was related to the exercise of State power or that it had called into question that “special bond of trust and loyalty” (see Vilho Eskelinen and Others, cited above, § 62).", "para_idx": 137}, {"section": "merits", "text": "80.  In Bilgen (cited above), the Court found that it would not be justified to exclude members of the judiciary from the protection of Article 6 of the Convention in matters concerning the conditions of their employment on the basis of the special bond of loyalty and trust to the State. In reaching that finding, the Court stated that, while the employment relationship between a civil servant and the State can traditionally be defined as one based on trust and loyalty to the executive branch in so far as employees of the State are required to implement government policies, the same does not hold true for members of the judiciary, who play a different and more independent role because of their duty to provide checks on government wrongdoing and abuse of power. Their employment relationship with the State must therefore be understood in the light of the specific guarantees essential for judicial independence and the principle of irremovability of judges. Thus, when referring to the special trust and loyalty that they must observe, it is loyalty to the rule of law and democracy and not to holders of State power. This complex aspect of the employment relationship between a judge and the State makes it necessary for members of the judiciary to be sufficiently distanced from other branches of the State in the performance of their duties, so that they can deliver decisions a fortiori on the basis of the requirements of law and justice, without fear or favour. It would be a fallacy to assume that judges can uphold the rule of law and give effect to the Convention if domestic law deprives them of the guarantees of the Articles of the Convention on matters directly touching their individual independence and impartiality (see the above-cited cases of Bilgen, § 79, and Grzęda, § 264).", "para_idx": 138}, {"section": "merits", "text": "81.  The Court therefore does not accept the Government’s plea that the exclusion of a judicial review of the decision on the applicant’s transfer can be justified on the basis of the exercise of State sovereignty.

In this way, Article 6 § 1 embodies the “right to a court”, of which the right of access, that is, the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters, constitutes one aspect only (see, among other authorities, Golder v. the United Kingdom, 21 February 1975, § 36, Series A no. 18; Al‑Dulimi and Montana Management Inc. v. Switzerland [GC], no. 5809/08, § 126, 21 June 2016; and Naït‑Liman v. Switzerland [GC], no. 51357/07, § 113, 15 March 2018).", "para_idx": 178}, {"section": "merits", "text": "110.  The Court further observes that an authority which is not classified as one of the courts of a given State may nevertheless, for the purposes of Article 6 § 1, fall within the concept of a “tribunal” in the substantive sense of this expression (see Sramek v. Austria, 22 October 1984, § 36, Series A no. 84). A court or tribunal is characterised in the substantive sense of the term by its judicial function, that is to say determining matters within its competence on the basis of rules of law, with full jurisdiction, and after proceedings conducted in a prescribed manner (ibid., and see Cyprus v. Turkey [GC], no. 25781/94, § 233, ECHR 2001‑IV). A power of decision is inherent in the very notion of “tribunal” within the meaning of the Convention.

For the purposes of Article 6 § 1 a tribunal need not be a court of law integrated within the standard judicial machinery. It may be set up to deal with a specific subject matter which can be appropriately administered outside the ordinary court system (see Rolf Gustafson v. Sweden, 1 July 1997, § 45, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997‑IV). Moreover, only an institution that has full jurisdiction and satisfies a number of requirements, such as independence from the executive and also from the parties, merits the designation “tribunal” within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 (see Beaumartin v.

It is therefore necessary to examine the whole of the proceedings aimed at a review of the applicant’s transfer in order to address the question whether he had an opportunity to submit the transfer at issue to a review satisfying the requirements of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.", "para_idx": 184}, {"section": "merits", "text": "115.  First, the Court notes the Government’s argument that the NCJ was not a judicial body and that it enjoyed a special status within the tripartite government system.

Consequently, a review of the applicant’s transfer carried out by a body which is not a court integrated within the standard judicial machinery, such as the NCJ, could in principle satisfy the requirements of review under Article 6 § 1 (for a recent example of such finding, see Suren Antonyan, cited above, §§ 120-29).", "para_idx": 185}, {"section": "merits", "text": "116.  That being said, the Court emphasises the distinction to be made between the NCJ (i) as regulated by the Polish Constitution, and (ii) as operating at the material time, after being recomposed under the 2017 Amending Act.

Consequently, even if the Court were to accept that the NCJ could be regarded as a “tribunal” for the purposes of a review of the applicant’s transfer, the established lack of independence of that body as it currently stands is sufficient for the Court to conclude that the review of the applicant’s transfer as effected by the NCJ did not satisfy the requirements of Article 6 § 1.", "para_idx": 186}, {"section": "merits", "text": "117.  This conclusion is further supported by the fact that very few safeguards were offered in the proceedings before the NCJ (compare with Eminağaoğlu, cited above, § 99).

According to the experts, the results of the toxicological-forensic examination indicated that R.M. had been a habitual cocaine user and that, at the time of his encounter with the carabinieri, he had been in a state of acute cocaine intoxication which had triggered a behavioural and pathological condition classified as “excited delirium syndrome”. Since the mid-1980s the relevant literature had been increasingly replete with papers and case reports of individuals exhibiting behavior attributable to this syndrome, although the term used to describe it was more recent. The joint occurrence of delirium, psychomotor agitation and excitement distinguished this syndrome from others, and among the triggering factors were the use of narcotics such as cocaine or alcohol, and the presence of a mental disorder.", "para_idx": 33}, {"section": "facts_proceedings", "text": "23.  Defining the clinical picture of such a syndrome was considered increasingly important, given the fatal outcomes that could result from it, to the point that in the years prior many associations of clinicians had developed guidelines to be followed in order to make accurate diagnoses, prevent deaths and improve the knowledge of both law-enforcement and health professionals on the issue. In that latter connection, the report noted that, despite the low reporting rate of deaths associated with the syndrome – partly explained by the fact that some deaths took place without witnesses – the majority of reported deaths occurred during or after intervention by law-enforcement or health professionals. It had also been noted in the literature that deaths often occurred after a period of apparent calm, during or after restraint manoeuvers by law-enforcement officers and attempts by the subject to free him or herself. This had led to growing attention being paid to the methods of arrest, immobilisation and restraint employed by law enforcement when confronted with individuals in such a state. The report mentioned guidance issued by some associations of physicians as of 2009, which included a recommendation that excited delirium syndrome be viewed as a medical emergency and that the police and healthcare services be alerted simultaneously. Another recommendation when dealing with such subjects was that the use of force should be kept to a minimum and medical intervention should be provided as quickly as possible to limit the release of catecholamines and the development of metabolic acidosis, both of which were important factors leading to the death of individuals experiencing excited delirium.", "para_idx": 34}, {"section": "facts_proceedings", "text": "24.  The report then reviewed studies investigating the particular role that immobilisation in a prone position might play in leading to the death of individuals experiencing the above-mentioned syndrome. Some of those studies showed that the prone position had interfered with respiratory mechanics, while other studies stated that the evidence of the causal connection was less certain. In certain cases where the heart had already been weakened by drugs such as cocaine, this had led to fatal consequences. In other studies autopsies had revealed signs of asphyxia in the causes of deaths, referred to as “positional asphyxia”, arising from breathing difficulties when individuals were immobilised in certain positions. In that context, the report noted recommendations on restraint in United Kingdom prisons issued in 2005, which stated, inter alia, that for agitated or violent subjects the prone position should be avoided unless strictly necessary, that any form of chest compression should be avoided, and that in the event of a medical emergency the prisoner should be released immediately to allow medical staff to provide timely assistance.", "para_idx": 35}, {"section": "facts_proceedings", "text": "25.  Turning to the manner of R.M.’s death, which was recorded as cardio‑circulatory arrest, the experts noted that the circumstances were consistent with those reported in the literature: the death had occurred after the subject had been immobilised by law enforcement and after a period of apparent calm. An electrocardiogram (ECG) performed on R.M. showed asystole, in which cocaine intoxication had undoubtedly played an important causal role. Another element of undoubted importance was that the dynamics of the arrest and subsequent immobilisation and R.M.’s struggle to free himself had induced an additional release of catecholamines. There was also evidence of asphyxiation. The experts could not establish whether and to what extent direct compression of R.M.’s neck, reported by witness testimony and supported in the evidence by a faint but bilateral haemorrhage in the lateral cervical region, had contributed to the asphyxia. However, the experts were certain that the asphyxia was relatable to R.M.’s having been held in a prone position for a prolonged period, which reduced respiratory dynamics. In summary, R.M.’s acute cocaine intoxication, the stress caused by his immobilisation and attempts to free himself, and the prone position in which he had been held were all factors that had contributed, jointly, to his death.", "para_idx": 36}, {"section": "facts_proceedings", "text": "26.  With regard to the time of death, it was noted that, according to the chronology reconstructed by the investigating authorities, R.M. appeared to have been alive at 1.33 a.m., when the first ambulance arrived. One of the first responders, who had approached R.M. to check his vital signs, put her hand under his mouth and apparently felt him breathing. The experts noted the unscientific nature of the manoeuvre, which they found to have been undoubtedly incorrect, and concluded that it was likely that the R.M. had already been in an unconscious state at that stage, as no words or movements were reported. Between 1.35 and 1.44 a.m. R.M. went into cardiorespiratory arrest. The doctor who arrived at 1.44 a.m. had attempted to resuscitate him, but to no avail. R.M. had already been dead when he arrived at the emergency room and the death, or at least the irreversible phase that preceded it, had occurred between 1.35 and 1.44 a.m. The experts stated that the asphyxiation would in all likelihood not have occurred if R.M.’s respiratory activity had been facilitated by placing him in a supine, seated or standing position.

Those included R.M.’s having grabbed a taxi driver by the neck saying things such as “you’re one of them too, you can’t do this to me”, R.M.’s having thrown around road signs, harassing a passer-by, attempting to stop and get into passing cars, shouting at the top of his voice with his chest exposed, entering a restaurant and taking someone’s mobile phone, and then breaking the glass door of a restaurant that he had entered.

It was clear from numerous eyewitness accounts that the police intervention had stemmed from the need to stop him in order to ensure his safety and that of the public, and also to identify him, as he was suspected of having committed offences for which arrest could have been envisaged. The court thus found that the handcuffing and immobilisation on the ground of R.M. carried out by the carabinieri had to be considered justified. Once handcuffed, it had also been logical and correct that they had maintained him in that position until he had calmed down, for a period of time that common sense would suggest was appropriate to his condition. However, the Court considered that – although the carabinieri had been justified in having handcuffed R.M., in placing him in a prone position and in keeping him in that position for a period of about two minutes (from 1.29 to 1.31 a.m.) necessary for observation – their keeping him in that prone position for longer than that and even after he had fallen silent had been unlawful.", "para_idx": 46}, {"section": "facts_proceedings", "text": "36.  The court considered that the basis for its assessment should be the behaviour expected of a “model police officer” who had undergone training based on the knowledge disseminated and in use at the time of the event. The handcuffing and prone positioning procedures used on R.M. were in accordance with a circular issued in 2008 (see paragraphs 59-61 below) relating to immobilisation and handcuffing. The court then cited another circular that had been issued on 30 January 2014, which included references to the prone position (see paragraphs 62-65 below), but found that that it had not yet entered into force at the material time and that no training had been delivered to the officers with respect to that circular. It noted that, during his testimony, Captain C. had acknowledged that the latter guidelines dealt with the risk of positional asphyxia associated with the prone position, which, prior to the date of issue of the 2014 circular, had been the subject of general knowledge but had not been mentioned in previous regulatory texts or been the subject of specific training. Nor could it be argued that the defendants should have relied on their own personal knowledge, because that would have meant allowing officers to disregard orders, with the consequent risk of arbitrary conduct. The court therefore ruled out the possibility of liability for the breach of written precautionary rules. At the same time, the court emphasised that the officers had not employed any thoracic compression or exerted pressure on any other parts of R.M.’s body in excess of the limits established in a scientific study submitted by the civil parties. The court noted in that connection that the asphyxia identified by the medical experts had not been caused by compression but had rather been positional.", "para_idx": 47}, {"section": "facts_proceedings", "text": "37.  Nevertheless, the court determined that a negligent failure to act (colpa di tipo omissivo) was at issue. Such a conclusion could be drawn from the holding of R.M. in a prone position by the officers even after R.M. had entered a state of calm – that is after 1.31 a.m. – in particular in view of the absence of vital signs, which required the officers to have intervened or to have called the emergency services instead of passively waiting for the ambulance with the doctor to arrive at 1.44 a.m. Their actions, in the court’s view, indicated an “obstinate conviction” that although R.M. had become motionless and silent he still needed to be restrained, regardless of his actual behaviour/condition. The offence was constituted by their failure to act promptly to change the position in which R.M. was being held, since the medical experts found that the asphyxiation had been linked to the officers holding him in a prone position. The officers had had a duty of care towards R.M. once he had been handcuffed and restrained, particularly because they themselves had created a source of danger. The lawful alternative behaviour which would have been warranted in the court’s view would have been to ask questions or move R.M., thus making it possible to detect his loss of consciousness and to intervene by placing him in a supine or sitting position, unfastening his handcuffs, allowing the ambulance personnel to monitor him and, if necessary, to administer CPR. Had they acted thus there was a high logical and statistical probability that the incident would not have occurred. As indicated by the medical experts appointed by the public prosecutor, the chances of success of CPR decrease by 7-10% with every minute that passes without intervention.", "para_idx": 48}, {"section": "facts_proceedings", "text": "38.  The court also examined the allegations, raised by the civil parties to the proceedings, that attempts had been made to mislead the investigation and manipulate evidence. It found that V.C. and A.D.’s conduct had not been unlawful. They had legitimately obtained information from the Red Cross volunteer C.M. as the events had just taken place, they had not yet been under investigation, their intervention had been ongoing and they had had to be proactive to assist with the reconstruction of what had happened. During the trial, the officers’ hierarchical superior, Captain C., reported that he had learned that V.C. and A.D. had taken statements from C.M. in the emergency room on their own initiative. That was also considered legitimate, given that at the time they had still been unaware that the investigation had been assigned to the investigative unit of the carabinieri. The court did not find evidence that the volunteer C.M. had been coerced into providing a favourable version of events. She had subsequently been heard on two further occasions, in normal and more reassuring circumstances, having had time and the opportunity to clarify the events in her mind, without changing her version of events, at least in terms of certain essential aspects. Consequently, there was insufficient evidence to substantiate the assertion that the statements made by her in the immediate aftermath of the event had been influenced by the carabinieri. The court considered that, in any event, her subsequent status as a defendant had influenced her overall reliability, as it could not be discounted that C.M. had progressively reinforced elements intended to justify her actions in subsequent interviews. Lastly, the court noted that C.M. was an experienced first responder, trained in CPR and the use of a defibrillator, which she had previously used in other rescue operations, and was therefore trained to operate in emotionally stressful situations, even in the presence of deceased persons. There was no reason why the carabinieri should have questioned her psychological stability at the moment of the interview at the hospital. As regards the witness whose statement had been taken by Officer S.C. and Captain C., his statement was found to be free from all suspicion of manipulation as he had never changed his account of the events. The court noted that the officers had also searched certain locations frequented by R.M. for evidence related to the event, which it considered to have been an entirely legitimate action on their part, as otherwise they could have been accused of malicious omission if they had not made any effort at all to gather such evidence.", "para_idx": 49}, {"section": "facts_proceedings", "text": "39.  D.A. was acquitted because at the time when his three colleagues were involved in the impugned acts he had left the scene to have his wound treated and to identify witnesses.", "para_idx": 50}, {"section": "facts_proceedings", "text": "40.  The Red Cross volunteers were also acquitted. Eyewitness statements and the defendants’ own accounts enabled the circumstances to be reconstructed unequivocally. This included the volunteers’ attempts to apply a saturation meter on R.M.’s finger, which once applied produced no results, and their requests to the officers to place R.M. in a supine position for more thorough monitoring. The officers refused, citing R.M.’s dangerousness. In the face of opposition from the officers, vital signs were checked by placing a hand under R.M.’s mouth. Amongst other things, the court noted that under Red Cross protocols rescuers can only intervene in a safe scenario. In the event that the situation is deemed to be unsafe, the rescuers have to request support from the operations centre. In this particular instance, it was clear that law-enforcement officers had classified the scenario as unsafe.

That position resulted in a limitation of R.M.’s respiratory activity and, consequently, his oxygen supply, which was particularly critical given his pre-existing intoxication.", "para_idx": 54}, {"section": "facts_proceedings", "text": "44.  As to the justification for resorting to the use of force, the officers had intervened following numerous phone calls to the police. In the court’s view it must have appeared very likely, because of R.M.’s disturbed state and the number of violent acts against people and property reported up to that point, that he could continue to commit similar acts. Accordingly, in apprehending R.M., the carabinieri had been carrying out their duty of maintaining public safety, and thus ensuring that he was stopped and did not escape their control, to prevent him from harming not only others but himself as well.", "para_idx": 55}, {"section": "facts_proceedings", "text": "45.  The court first noted that the evidence showed that R.M had been in a severe state of physical and mental agitation when confronted by the carabinieri. Attempts to calm him down verbally had been useless: the carabinieri had initially approached him with their hands raised above their heads and tried to establish dialogue, but he had kept screaming, appeared delirious, and would not keep still. Four carabinieri had stood around him in a semicircle and followed him as he walked away. There was then what the court described as inevitable physical contact to try to stop him and attempt to handcuff him, which he had resisted, hitting one of the carabinieri in the process. The carabinieri, therefore, had had no other alternative but to apply force to immobilise him once the attempt to calm him down by intervening with raised hands and trying to talk to him had failed. Even so, the court held that, considering R.M.’s evident pathological condition, the use of force had to have been kept to a minimum and that constant monitoring of R.M.’s condition had been imperative.", "para_idx": 56}, {"section": "facts_proceedings", "text": "46.  However, the officers’ keeping of R.M., who had been in a seriously disturbed state, immobilised in a prone position had prevented him from receiving the oxygen he needed, which had proved to be lethal. The officers had failed to consider that R.M.’s behaviour after immobilisation – vocally expressing discomfort and asking for help, then gradually losing strength and speaking with a progressively weaker voice, and finally becoming unresponsive and falling silent – could have been a sign of breathing difficulties. The court found it significant that after R.M. had stopped moving one of the Red Cross volunteers who had arrived in the meantime had raised his eyelid without provoking any reaction on R.M.’s part, when such a reaction should have been immediate and instinctive. R.M.’s state of calm could therefore have been interpreted as a loss of consciousness, and that consideration should have obliged the officers to change his position. Furthermore, the court found no justification for keeping R.M. immobilised in a prone position when there were four officers present who could have restrained his hands and feet in a different position while still ensuring his safety and that of others. Despite that, R.M. had been kept immobilised in a prone position even after he had fallen still, as confirmed by several witnesses, including one of the police officers involved, albeit without any proven compression to the thoracic, scapular or back area.", "para_idx": 57}, {"section": "facts_proceedings", "text": "47.  The court of appeal found that it had not been necessary for the officers to have had any medical knowledge to know that the prone position made breathing difficult even without direct compression to the chest owing to the compression of the front part of the pulmonary apparatus, especially when the body was in contact with a hard surface such as a road with the arms handcuffed behind the back and the legs pinned down.", "para_idx": 58}, {"section": "facts_proceedings", "text": "48.  Nevertheless, the officers had kept him in the prone position, carelessly neglecting to consider that the obvious breathing difficulties R.M. was experiencing entailed a risk of asphyxiation, which had been, in the court’s view, foreseeable in the circumstances.

It reiterated the factual findings as to the dangerous conduct displayed by R.M. and his severe psychophysical agitation. According to the well-reasoned conclusions reached by the lower courts, the officers had had no alternative but to stop R.M. because he had appeared to pose a danger to himself and others, especially given that their attempts to calm him down had failed, that R.M. had attempted to flee and that he had hit an officer.", "para_idx": 63}, {"section": "facts_proceedings", "text": "53.  It noted that the determination of the three-fold cause of R.M.’s death was correct.

Such information had obviously been lacking until then and that, in the court’s view, could not be ignored when assessing the concrete foreseeability of the death.

The lower courts therefore had had to address, and had done so in a contradictory manner, the ex ante foreseeability of the fatal outcome. The Court of Cassation considered that the officers could not have been expected to recognise the seriousness of the situation and the consequences which could have resulted from it, and did not find convincing the elements identified by the lower courts. It noted that the Red Cross volunteers had arrived two to three minutes after R.M. had stopped speaking and it had not occurred to them, who had more medical experience, that R.M. was in imminent danger or had had breathing difficulties. Nevertheless, according to the lower courts, the officers should have realised that themselves, since it was well known that it is more difficult to breathe when lying on the ground in a prone position and handcuffed. R.M.’s silence could have had at least two other possible interpretations, namely that the delirium had subsided and he had decided to stop resisting the carabinieri, or that he had merely been pretending to have calmed down in order to be able to react again when the officers’ guard was down.

They pointed to a growing recognition over time of the dangers of the prone position. In this regard, they referred to elements of international practice reported in the case of Saoud v. France (no. 9375/02, 9 October 2007, §§ 60-63).

Indeed, such a risk had been recognised by the carabinieri authorities themselves when they, by means of the 2014 circular, acknowledged the need to instruct officers on arrest technique to minimise possible harmful consequences. That circular was the only one providing instructions on the progressive use of force and the only one which mentioned the risks of the prone position in terms of positional asphyxia, especially with regard to subjects in a state of psychophysical agitation resulting from illness, alcohol and/or drugs.

Once the officers had restrained R.M., who had continued to struggle and shout, they did not apply pressure to the chest and shoulder area, as had been shown in the domestic proceedings. The fact that R.M. had been kept in a prone position for some minutes after he had finished struggling was only one of the causes of death. As the national courts had established on the basis of expert reports, the prone position alone would not have led to the death of a healthy person in the absence of a state of severe alteration. The Government stressed that R.M. had been using cocaine very heavily over the preceding months and that on that evening he had been in a state of delirium owing to acute intoxication, with high stress levels and release of catecholamines occurring even at the mere approach of the police. It had thus been only in combination with other causes that the prone position had proved to be risky in the present case.

That provision, in addition to limiting the circle of persons authorised to use weapons and force, emphasised the need for such use of force to be objectively aimed at achieving the purpose for which it is legally authorised. The case-law of the Court of Cassation strictly interpreted Article 53 and the conditions under which the use of weapons and, in general, of force and any means of physical coercion was lawful, considering it an extrema ratio.

Among the latter, they highlighted the part dealing with handcuffing on the ground, a technique used when arresting a particularly dangerous person or one who showed signs of resistance. They also noted and described the content of the circular adopted on 30 January 2014, which dealt with the management of interventions involving persons in a state of serious psychological and physical disturbance owing to illness or drug or alcohol consumption (see paragraphs 62‑65 above). They noted that the circular had not yet been operational at the material time, but argued that the officers involved in the events complained of had complied with its contents in substance. Those guidelines had been updated in 2015, but only in terms of practical illustrations, with the rest of the content remaining unchanged. On 19 January 2016 another circular, repealing the 2014 circular and the 2015 update, provided a further update of the operational intervention procedures following provision being made for the use of tonfa defensive sticks and pepper spray, along with references to the management of interventions involving persons in a state of serious psychophysical disturbance. They stressed that the document reiterates the general criteria of progressiveness and proportionality of interventions. On 19 February 2019 a new circular on interventions concerning persons in a state of psychophysical disturbance was issued, incorporating the 2008 guidelines by reiterating the content of the circular of 19 January 2016, which was therefore repealed.

It was reported that R.M. had grabbed a taxi driver by the neck, manhandled a passer-by on the street, attempted to stop and enter moving vehicles, and damaged property (see paragraph 33 above). The officers who were dispatched to intervene at the scene in response to the emergency calls reported that R.M. was in an evident state of distress and severe agitation, prompting them to request the assistance of emergency medical services (see paragraph 7 above). R.M. was thus in a recognised state of particular vulnerability requiring a high degree of precaution in the choice of “usual” arrest techniques (see T.V. v. Croatia, no. 47909/19, § 58, 11 June 2024). The Court notes that the officers initially approached him with their hands raised above their heads and de-escalation efforts were made, namely by attempting to establish a dialogue with him and calm him down verbally (see paragraphs 33, 35, 45, and 52 above). It is apparent from the case file that those attempts were unsuccessful as R.M.’s state of extreme agitation persisted and he tried to evade the officers. When the officers once again approached him and tried to handcuff him, R.M. offered physical resistance and – whether intentionally or not – injured one of the officers by hitting him in the head.

However, the document makes no reference to the potential risks associated with the holding of a person in such a position, nor does it contain any consequential guidance on how to minimise such risks. The Court also notes the domestic courts’ reliance on the testimony of a hierarchical superior of the officers involved who, while being examined during the trial, cited the 2014 circular as highlighting the risk of positional asphyxia associated with the prone position, which, while being a subject of general knowledge, had not been contained in previous regulatory texts (see paragraph 36 above).", "para_idx": 173}, {"section": "merits", "text": "131.  The Court further considers that the issuing of a specific circular in 2014 may be viewed as disclosing an awareness on the part of the law‑enforcement authorities themselves that persons in a state of physical and mental agitation caused, amongst other things, by the consumption of drugs, were at increased risk of adverse health consequences in relation to the use of force to restrain or contain them, including by means of the prone position, and of the consequent need to provide instructions to their officers in that respect (see paragraph 62 and 64 above). The Court of Cassation considered that the issuing of the 2014 circular specifically on that subject clearly demonstrated that there had been a need to ensure officers’ comprehension of the possible risks when confronted with individuals in such a state, both for the officers themselves and for the health and safety of the individual concerned, and of the need to minimise such risks (see paragraphs 54 and 56 above).", "para_idx": 174}, {"section": "merits", "text": "132.  Although it might be open to question whether that circular could be viewed as providing officers with sufficiently clear and detailed instructions on the use of the prone position when immobilising individuals, at the very least it acknowledged that there might be risks associated with the use thereof, and directed its use be avoided and limited if possible, albeit in very general terms. That being said, as can be seen from the domestic decisions, that circular could not be considered to have been in force at the time of R.M.’s death (see paragraphs 36 and 54 above).", "para_idx": 175}, {"section": "merits", "text": "133.  In the light of the above, the Court cannot but conclude that the guidelines in place at the relevant time, in so far as they were constituted by the documents relied on by the Government, did not provide clear and adequate instructions on placing individuals in a prone position, with a view to reducing to a minimum the risks to the health and life of the person concerned.", "para_idx": 176}, {"section": "merits", "text": "134.  Lastly, the Court is also mindful of the fact that the 2014 circular was superseded by another circular in 2016 (see paragraph 66 above), which itself was replaced in 2019 by a new document (see paragraph  67 above). While not temporally material to the impugned events and therefore beyond the scope of its direct assessment, the Court cannot but express concern over the fact that references to possible health risks associated with protracted struggles and prolonged immobilisations, particularly when subjects are placed on the ground in a prone position, and to the need to mitigate such risks, with consequential instructions, were omitted from the 2016 and 2019 circulars, leaving open the question, at least on the basis of the material in the Court’s possession, whether and in what way such issues have been considered in guidance materials after the repeal of the 2014 circular.", "para_idx": 177}, {"section": "merits", "text": "‒    Training of law-enforcement officers", "para_idx": 178}, {"section": "merits", "text": "135.  The establishment of guidelines, as addressed in the previous paragraphs, is closely linked to the proper training of law-enforcement officers.

In essence, the public prosecutor had been able to entrust the investigation to the police force to which the suspects belonged owing to the fact that in the Italian legal system the prosecutor may choose freely. For that reason they argued that he could just as easily have entrusted the investigation to the State police or another police force.

They referred, in particular, to the fact that although the public prosecutor initially decided to prosecute the officers for manslaughter committed with others (see paragraph 20 above), he subsequently requested that they be tried only for causing death by negligence (see paragraph 29 above). They further criticised the first instance court’s decision to limit criminally relevant conduct from the moment in which R.M. had become silent, and the court’s finding that the 2014 Circular had not been in force at the material time, which further limited the scope of criminal responsibility.

In the Government’s view, the cause of death had been unclear at the time and there had been no visible wounds on R.M..

What is at stake here is nothing less than public confidence in the State’s monopoly on the use of force (see Hugh Jordan v. the United Kingdom, no. 24746/94, § 106, 4 May 2001; Ramsahai and Others v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 52391/99, § 325, ECHR 2007‑II; and Kolevi v. Bulgaria, no. 1108/02, § 193, 5 November 2009).", "para_idx": 203}, {"section": "merits", "text": "(ii)    Application to the present case", "para_idx": 204}, {"section": "merits", "text": "154.  The Court notes at the outset that some of the police officers directly involved in the impugned events conducted initial investigative steps, namely by taking statements from witnesses on the same night of the events (see paragraphs 13 and 15 above). In this respect, the applicants placed particular emphasis on the fact that Officers V.C. and A.D. had interviewed the Red Cross volunteer C.M. immediately after the events and in the emergency room where R.M. had been taken. It was established in the domestic proceedings that V.C. and A.D. had taken such steps “on their own initiative” (see paragraph 38 above). It further appears from the domestic decisions that the conduct in question could not be regarded as disclosing any irregularity or unlawfulness (see paragraph 38 above). The Court notes that, according to the documents on file, the prosecutor was alerted at around the same time as C.M.’s statement was being taken and, as also stated by the Government, had reached a decision on whom the first investigative acts into the events were to be entrusted (see paragraph 14 above).", "para_idx": 205}, {"section": "merits", "text": "155.  The Court accepts the particular importance of that Red Cross volunteer as an eyewitness, given that she had been in close proximity to R.M. and the officers for a significant part of the impugned incident, and had had an opportunity to directly interact with and to observe the conduct of the officers. The Court cannot fail to note that the testimony of the first responders figured with some prominence in the Court of Cassation’s reasoning leading to the officers’ acquittal (see paragraph 55 above). The Court cannot speculate whether C.M. would have made different statements if she had not been interviewed by officers V.C. and A.D., and what impact different testimony might have had on the proceedings, which was what the applicants appeared to have been suggesting, let alone on the proceedings’ final outcome. The Court further acknowledges the Government’s argument, backed by the findings of the domestic courts, that there was no evidence of the officers having coerced that witness – or the second one, who was interviewed by Captain C. and Officer S.C. – into giving their statements in a certain manner, or that they had exerted any direct pressure on the witnesses. That being said, the Court cannot but be mindful of the real risk of indirect influence or pressure arising from the mere fact that a witness to an incident involving law‑enforcement officers has to give a statement on that incident to those very officers. The Court further recognises the critical role of the first investigative steps in setting the investigation’s course.

The Government’s arguments in this regard hinged on the purported need for the officers to take immediate action to find R.M.’s drug supplier on the suspicion that his death could have been due to an overdose, and on the first instance court’s finding, in the context of looking for evidence in places that R.M. had frequented, that their inaction could have been sanctioned for omission of official acts.

The assessment of this minimum is relative and depends on all the circumstances of the case, and the severity of a breach should be gauged taking account of both the applicant’s subjective perceptions and what was objectively at stake. However, even if it is found that the applicant has not suffered a significant disadvantage as a result of the matter complained of, the complaint may nonetheless not be declared inadmissible on this ground if respect for human rights, as defined in the Convention and the Protocols thereto, requires an examination on the merits (see, as a recent authority, X and others v.

This scrutiny should encompass, among other things, such elements as contribution to a debate of general interest and whether the case involves the press or other news media (see, for example, Sylka v. Poland (dec.), no. 19219/07, § 28, 3 June 2014, with further references).", "para_idx": 42}, {"section": "admissibility", "text": "36.  Applying these principles to the present case, the Court notes that the issue at hand was clearly of significant subjective importance to the applicant, who viewed the alleged violation as raising a question of principle. Specifically, the civil proceedings, in her view, were closely linked to her fundamental right to criticise the actions of high-ranking public officials through the media. As to what was objectively at stake, the applicant’s role as a regular opinion writer for the association “Peščanik” website underscores the broader context of the alleged violation. The interference must therefore be assessed in the light of the essential role a free press plays in ensuring the proper functioning of a democratic society (see Falzon v. Malta, no. 45791/13, § 57, 20 March 2018, concerning factual circumstances very similar to those in the present case as regards the status of the applicant as an opinion writer in particular). Accordingly, the alleged breach of Article 10 of the Convention in the present case indeed raises an “important question of principle”. The Court is thus satisfied that it cannot be said that the applicant suffered no significant disadvantage as a result of the civil proceedings, regardless of the relatively insubstantial pecuniary consequences for her referred to by the Government. Hence, the Court does not deem it necessary to consider whether respect for human rights would compel it to examine the case or whether it was duly considered by a domestic tribunal (see, mutatis mutandis, M.N. and Others v. San Marino, no. 28005/12, § 39, 7 July 2015).", "para_idx": 43}, {"section": "admissibility", "text": "37.  Accordingly, the Government’s objection in this context must be rejected.", "para_idx": 44}, {"section": "admissibility", "text": "38.  The Court notes that this complaint is neither manifestly ill-founded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in Article 35 of the Convention.

Where the right to freedom of expression is being balanced against the right to respect for private life, the Court has laid down a number of relevant criteria in its case-law, including whether the impugned statements contributed to a debate of public interest; the degree of notoriety of the person affected and the subject of the publication; the context within which the impugned statements were made; the content, form and consequences of the publication; the prior conduct of the person concerned; the way in which the information was obtained and its veracity; and the nature and severity of the penalty imposed (see, among many other authorities, Axel Springer AG v. Germany [GC], no. 39954/08, §§ 89-95, 7 February 2012).", "para_idx": 62}, {"section": "merits", "text": "49.  A distinction must be made between private individuals and individuals acting in a public context.

Similarly, while the Court of Appeal acknowledged that value judgments were, in principle, protected, it held that, in the applicant’s case, they did not relate to a matter of public interest (see paragraph 12 in fine above). However, in view of the domestic courts’ reasoning, the Court is not persuaded by their approach and does not share their conclusions. Considering the full content of the article and the applicant’s explanations before the domestic courts, the Court notes that journalistic freedom allows for some exaggeration, provocation, or immoderate statements. The Court considers the expressions in question to be opinions. These opinions were voiced provocatively and caustically, using language that could be seen as insulting. However, they reflected the applicant’s subjective assessment of N.S.’s actions and statements, as described in the article.

The article in question was a direct response to N.S.’s own public statements regarding the events in question. When viewed in the context of the article, the impugned expressions were intended as a harsh critique of his response to alleged violent demolitions that had taken place in the centre of Belgrade, including the “unidentified perpetrators unlawfully detaining several individuals present in the area, releasing them only after the demolition was complete” and “these individuals subsequently contacting the police, who failed to respond or attend the scene” (see paragraph 5 above) – an issue of significant public interest in the Serbian context. Moreover, at the time, an intense public debate was underway concerning both accountability for these acts and the inadequacy of the response by law enforcement authorities. The applicant’s statements were therefore a part of this broader discourse on matters of public concern, where few restrictions are acceptable under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention (see, among many other authorities, Sürek v. Turkey (no. 1) [GC], no. 26682/95, § 61, ECHR 1999-IV). They were not intended to “wantonly denigrate”, that is to simply insult N.S. In fact, the applicant was careful enough to put the impugned expressions into context and explain them: she took reasonable care to articulate clearly why, in her view, the way the police had handled the crime in question and the way in which N.S. had explained the apparent lack of police reaction deserved such a strong reaction from her side in the public debate (see paragraph 7 above; contrast Skałka v. Poland, no. 43425/98, §§ 36-37, 27 May 2003).", "para_idx": 70}, {"section": "merits", "text": "56.  The Court notes that, in the present case, the applicant was ordered to pay approximately EUR 2,100 jointly with three other defendants as compensation for non-pecuniary damage and costs.

As to the second requirement, having regard to the Court’s practice in similar cases, the Constitutional Court’s instruction to the Supreme Court to re-hear the applicant’s case amounts to sufficient redress, such that the applicant can no longer claim to be a victim of the alleged violation (see, among other authorities, Lozhkin v. Russia (dec.) no. 16384/08, 22 October 2013). This is particularly so, given that the applicant did not claim any damages for this alleged violation before the Court (see paragraph 66 below).

Article 10 does not apply solely to certain types of information or ideas or forms of expression, in particular those of a political nature; it also encompasses artistic expression (see Müller and Others v Switzerland, 24 May 1988, § 27, Series A no. 133), information of a commercial nature (see Casado Coca, cited above, §§ 35-37, and compare Krone Verlag GmbH & Co.

The breadth of a State’s margin of appreciation varies depending on a number of factors, among which the type of speech at issue is of particular importance. While there is little scope under Article 10 § 2 of the Convention for restrictions on political speech (see Ceylan v. Turkey [GC], no. 23556/94, § 34, ECHR 1999‑IV), States have a broad margin of appreciation in the regulation of speech in commercial matters or advertising (see markt intern Verlag GmbH and Klaus Beermann v. Germany, 20 November 1989, § 33, Series A no. 165, and Casado Coca, cited above, § 50).", "para_idx": 150}, {"section": "merits", "text": "39.  With respect to audiovisual media, the Court has held that the task of service providers to impart information necessarily brings “duties and responsibilities” which include a duty to impose limits on themselves, and that wherever information brings a person’s image into play, the media are required to take into account, in so far as possible, the impact of the information, pictures or video recordings to be published prior to their dissemination (see I.V.Ț. v. Romania, no. 35582/15, § 48, 1 March 2022). Where the “duties and responsibilities” of journalists, service providers and television channels are concerned, the potential impact of the medium of expression involved is an important factor in assessing the proportionality of the interference. In this context, the Court has acknowledged that account must be taken of the fact that the audiovisual media have a more immediate and powerful effect than the print media. The former have means of conveying through images meanings which the print media are not able to impart (see NIT S.R.L., cited above, § 182). This applies a fortiori to publications on the internet, since the capacity of the internet to store and transmit information, and the risk of harm to the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and freedoms posed by content and communications on the internet – particularly harm to the right to respect for one’s private life – is certainly higher than that posed by the press (see Bild GmbH & Co.

Italy [GC], no. 25358/12, § 159, ECHR 2017). A person’s image constitutes one of the chief attributes of his or her personality, as it reveals the person’s unique characteristics and distinguishes the person from his or her peers. The right of each person to the protection of his or her image presupposes the right to control the use of that image. While in most cases it means the individual must be given an opportunity to veto publication of the image, it also covers the individual’s right to object to the recording, conservation and reproduction of the image (see López Ribalda and Others v.

Switzerland (dec.), no. 14991/02, 14 June 2005, and Petrenco v. Moldova, no. 20928/05, § 55, 30 March 2010). The limits of critical comments about public figures are wider, as they are inevitably and knowingly exposed to public scrutiny and must therefore show a particularly high degree of tolerance (see Milisavljević v. Serbia, no. 50123/06, § 34, 4 April 2017, and Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associés, cited above, § 121).", "para_idx": 154}, {"section": "merits", "text": "(β)      Application of these principles to the present case", "para_idx": 155}, {"section": "merits", "text": "43.  In the present case, it is noted at the outset that the domestic courts did not weigh up the conflicting interests.

Even though the domestic courts have failed to apply the criteria laid down in the Court’s case‑law for balancing freedom of expression with the right to private life, in view of the circumstances of the case (see paragraphs 5-6 and 18 above), the Court will carry out the required balancing exercise (for a similar approach see Mesić v.

It also takes note of the Supreme’s Court concerns about the racist and offensive tone of the comedian’s remarks which provoked the heated altercation between him and M.G. and M.C. later used in the promotional video of the show and in episodes 1 and 4 of the documentary series (see paragraph 8 and 18 above and compare Sigma Radio Television Ltd, cited above, § 208).

Nonetheless, such margin is not unlimited, and the Court has to assess whether the national authorities overstepped it (compare Sekmadienis Ltd., cited above, § 76).", "para_idx": 158}, {"section": "merits", "text": "46.  As to how well known the persons concerned were and their prior conduct, it is undisputed that M.G. and M.C. are both private individuals, not known to the public.

Although the extract in which M.G. and M.C. appear is only brief, it was broadcast by SIC Radical in its promotional video for at least 45 days, several times a day, and episode 1 and 4 of the series were broadcast 12 and 13 times each. The content was also made available on SIC Radical’s website and on the comedian’s YouTube channel (see paragraph 13 above). The Court therefore accepts that the broadcasting of these videos was embarrassing and capable of tarnishing or causing prejudice to the reputation of M.G. and M.C., with possible adverse effects on both their professional and personal lives. It therefore finds that the broadcasting of their images and voices without their consent attained a sufficient level of seriousness to threaten the personal enjoyment by M.G. and M.C. of their rights under Article 8 of the Convention (see Stancu and Others v. Romania, no. 22953/16, § 121, 18 October 2022).", "para_idx": 162}, {"section": "merits", "text": "50.  Moreover, the Court finds that the applicant company failed to take steps to minimise any adverse effects by not seeking the explicit consent of M.G. or M.C. and by not blurring their faces or distorting their voices (compare Peck v. the United Kingdom, no. 44647/98, § 85, ECHR 2003‑I, and Hájovský, cited above, § 49), thus creating a feeling of being ridiculed and increased public exposure (see paragraph 18 above).

It constitutes sexual harassment to stroke, paw or grope the victim’s genitals or breasts, whether inside or outside clothing ...

If a finger is inserted into the vagina, the behaviour has reached another level, namely ‘other sexual relations’.

Pawing or groping other parts of the body may constitute sexual harassment.

In cases involving physical contact, the conduct would be deemed sexual harassment. In light of research on sexual harassment in various contexts and its onerous effects on victims, this Bill proposes that the lower limit of the concept of sexual harassment be expanded. The concept will therefore not be confined to physical contact but may also include speech and symbolic gestures that are highly injurious, repeated or likely to cause fear.

Any legal or prosecutorial approach that requires proof of physical resistance risks failing to protect sexual autonomy and enabling impunity. Accordingly, domestic law must ensure that all non-consensual sexual acts are criminalised and effectively prosecuted, including where the victim did not resist physically (see M.C. v. Bulgaria, cited above, §§ 150, 154 and 157-66; E.G. v. the Republic of Moldova, no. 37882/13, § 39, 13 April 2021, and Z v. Czech Republic, no. 37782/21, § 52, 20 June 2024).", "para_idx": 51}, {"section": "merits", "text": "39.  The procedural obligation involves the duty of the domestic authorities to conduct an effective investigation into credible allegations of sexual assault.

The explanatory materials clarify that the upper boundary of Article 199 is reached where the intensity or duration of the touching escalates, for instance through finger penetration, which then falls under Article 194. The framework therefore penalises touching of a sexual nature which, depending on its intensity or duration, may remain within Article 199 or amount to “other sexual relations” punishable as rape under Article 194.

While lack of consent is only expressly mentioned in the first paragraph, the Explanatory report clarifies that the second paragraph covers situations where the victim lacks the capacity to give consent (see paragraphs 19 and 22 above).

In this respect, he acknowledged that the applicant had not touched him in return and that no conversation had taken place (see paragraph 11 above). Notwithstanding these admissions, the domestic authorities accepted his assertion that the contact was not of a sexual nature and that he ceased once he perceived discomfort, and on that basis concluded that the subjective element of intent under Article 199 was not sufficiently established to sustain prosecution (see paragraphs 14 and 16 above).", "para_idx": 59}, {"section": "merits", "text": "46.  The Court reiterates that the principal issue in the present case is whether the domestic authorities fulfilled their positive obligation to apply the legal framework in a manner capable of establishing the facts and, where appropriate, prosecuting the perpetrator.

The crucial element was not whether O. stopped upon perceiving discomfort, but that he had initiated sexual contact without any prior indication of consent from the applicant who, while having reached the minimum age for sexual consent, was still a minor. The failure to evaluate the admitted touching against the consent-based standard articulated in both the domestic and international legal framework (see paragraphs 24-25 and 38-39 above) meant that the investigation was not geared towards establishing whether there had been non-consensual sexual contact and thus did not secure in practice the protection of the applicant’s physical and psychological integrity.", "para_idx": 61}, {"section": "merits", "text": "48.  In view of the decisive deficiency identified above, namely the prosecuting authorities’ failure to apply a consent-centred standard to the admitted touching, the Court, without expressing an opinion on O.’s guilt, concludes that there has been a violation of the procedural limb of Article 8 of the Convention.", "para_idx": 62}, {"section": "merits", "text": "49.  The applicant complained under Article 14 of the Convention, read in conjunction with Article 8, that she had suffered discrimination as a woman in the enjoyment of her Convention rights.

The interpretation of Article 199 of the GPC was “skewed” in favour of perpetrators, even where admissions had been made. Despite the reforms undertaken by the Government in recent years, the continuing lack of effective investigations leading to prosecution demonstrated, in her view, an insufficient commitment on the part of the authorities to take appropriate measures to address sexual violence against women. The applicant further contended that violence against women was treated differently within the system from other forms of violence where the victims were male. She submitted that sexual violence was distinctive, as the evidentiary threshold was effectively impossible to meet and the authorities systematically minimised or disregarded evidence specific to such cases. Relying on statistical data from Stígamót indicating a disparity in prosecution rates between gender-based violence and other violent crimes, she submitted that these figures demonstrated a systematic and unacceptable problem whereby women who brought charges for gender-based violence were unlikely to see their cases prosecuted and were far less likely to obtain an indictment than victims of other forms of violence.", "para_idx": 66}, {"section": "merits", "text": "52.  The Government submitted that Icelandic law and practice had long ensured equal protection against sexual and gender-based violence for all individuals, irrespective of sex, and that the provisions of the GPC were gender-neutral with identical burdens of proof.

Moreover, the statistics do not establish that cases involving male victims are treated differently by the authorities.

The Higher Court noted that it was not the case that all the articles and the publication of the photographs had to be considered as a whole, since the publication of photographs interfered with one’s intimacy far more than words. Consequently, it considered it necessary, when weighing up the competing rights to freedom of expression and to one’s honour and reputation, to distinguish the text of the articles from the published photographs and to carry out a separate balancing of the conflicting interests in connection with the photographs. The Higher Court recognised that the disputed photograph of B.G. portrayed him not only in his well-known public role as a politician but also, and inseparably, in his role as a father.

It determined that the articles published in the subsequent issues of Mladina (see paragraph 12 above) could not be considered in conjunction with the article in Issue No. 9 (see paragraphs 8-9 above). Additionally, it concluded that the editorial and the impugned article in that same issue could not be regarded as directly connected to one another owing to the complete separation between the corresponding sections. Therefore, the Supreme Court affirmed that the disputed article in “Mladinamit” had to be assessed separately, taking into account the photograph and the entire context of the article’s publication. The Supreme Court acknowledged that “Mladinamit” was a satirical section and thus enjoyed wider protection. However, it affirmed that the comparison between the published family photographs went beyond a comparison of political methods. It observed that, placed side by side, the published photographs were of identical dimensions and composition, thereby creating a multi-layered comparison between B.G.’s family and that of Joseph Goebbels.

The Constitutional Court also considered that the wider context comprised the textual articles published in the same issue of Mladina and in the following one. The narrower context for the publication of the photographs encompassed a textual dimension (the title and the short caption just above the photographs), in which the applicant company satirically drew a comparison between B.G. and Joseph Goebbels as manipulative politicians (see paragraph 8 above), and a visual dimension, in which the applicant company compared their families by placing the impugned photographs side by side (see paragraph 9 above).

In this regard, the Constitutional Court based its findings on the perspective of the average reader, concluding that such a reader would most likely see a comparison between the two families. The Constitutional Court relied heavily on the specific effect that the photographs (as opposed to the text) could be expected to have on readers, especially given the negative associations attached to the figure of Joseph Goebbels, regardless of the readers’ awareness of Joseph Goebbels’ murder of his children. It dismissed the applicant company’s submission that the criticism had not been aimed at B.G. as a person but at his political methods. The Constitutional Court took into account that B.G. was a public figure and was thus expected to be more tolerant of criticism and it also had regard to the satiric nature of the publication. However, B.G. was depicted as a father and, as such, deserved protection against unjustified intrusions affecting his family. Although B.G. had exposed his family to the press, this did not imply that he had thereby given his consent for the photographs to be published in any context. Moreover, the Constitutional Court noted that, even if B.G. and his political party, the SDS, engaged in harsh criticism of others, including using references to Nazism and Fascism, this did not justify the inappropriate comparison between B.G.’s family and that of Joseph Goebbels. The Constitutional Court also found that the outcome of the examination of the rights in question would most likely have been different if the visual aspect of the satirical contribution had focused solely on the comparison between B.G. and Joseph Goebbels in their political roles, as had the textual parts, and not also on their families.

The general principles applicable to the balancing of these rights, as well as the appropriate approach to be taken to that end, were summarised in Medžlis Islamske Zajednice Brčko and Others (cited above, §§ 77-78) and Annen v. Germany (no. 6) (no. 3779/11, §§ 22-23, 18 October 2018).", "para_idx": 75}, {"section": "merits", "text": "53.  As regards freedom of expression in the context of reporting and publishing photographs, the question of assessing the necessity of an interference with that freedom and the State’s margin of appreciation in that regard, the Court refers to its established case-law in the cases of Couderc and Hachette Filipacchi Associés( cited above, §§ 83-87 and 90‑93), Von Hannover v. Germany (no. 2) ([GC], nos. 40660/08 and 60641/08, §§ 95-107, ECHR 2012) and Axel Springer AG v. Germany ([GC], no. 39954/08, §§ 78-88, 7 February 2012).", "para_idx": 76}, {"section": "merits", "text": "54.  The Court would emphasise that while freedom of expression includes the publication of photographs, this is nonetheless an area in which the protection of the rights and reputation of others takes on particular importance, as photographs may contain very personal or even intimate information about an individual and his or her family (see Von Hannover (no. 2), cited above, § 103, and Eerikäinen and Others v. Finland, no. 3514/02, § 70, 10 February 2009).

Slovakia (no. 3), no. 37986/09, § 77, 7 January 2014, and Saaristo and Others v. Finland, no. 184/06, §§ 56-57, 12 October 2010).", "para_idx": 81}, {"section": "merits", "text": "(b)   Application of the above principles to the present case", "para_idx": 82}, {"section": "merits", "text": "59.  The Court observes at the outset that the interference with the applicant company’s right to freedom of expression related to the publication of a photo of a well-known Slovenian politician, B.G., and his family alongside a photo of the family of a German Nazi politician, Joseph Goebbels, in Issue No. 9 of the applicant company’s weekly magazine, Mladina, in March 2011. The photos in questions were published in the satiric section of the magazine, and were accompanied by a brief commentary (see paragraphs 8-9 above). The same issue of Mladina also included an editorial which drew parallels between the political methods employed by the SDS political party, represented, inter alia, by B.G., and those of the members of the German Nazi Party (see paragraph 7 above).", "para_idx": 83}, {"section": "merits", "text": "60.  The Court finds that the publication of a photograph of B.G.’s family positioned adjacent to a family photograph of a German Nazi politician, constituted an attack on B.G.’s reputation serious enough to bring the right to respect for private life under Article 8 into play (see also Fuchsmann v. Germany, no. 71233/13, § 30, 19 October 2017, and Medžlis Islamske Zajednice Brčko and Others, cited above, § 79). The domestic courts were therefore required to strike a fair balance between two rights guaranteed by the Convention – namely, on the one hand, freedom of expression enshrined in Article 10 and, on the other, the right to respect for private life, as enshrined in Article 8 (see paragraph 52 above).", "para_idx": 84}, {"section": "merits", "text": "61.  The Court observes in this connection that in the defamation proceedings instituted by B.G. against the applicant company the domestic courts acknowledged that the case concerned a conflict of two rights, namely the right to freedom of expression and the right to reputation, and recognised the importance of the applicant company’s freedom to publish critical comments about B.G. (see paragraphs 20 and 22 above). The domestic courts determined that the publication of the textual material did not encroach upon B.G.’s right to reputation (see paragraph 18 above). Conversely, they concluded that an infringement had occurred with the publication and comparison of the photographs of B.G.’s and Joseph Goebbels’ respective families (see paragraphs 18, 20 and 24 above).", "para_idx": 85}, {"section": "merits", "text": "62.  In exercising its supervisory function, the Court is called upon to ascertain, in the light of the case as a whole, whether the domestic courts when striking the above balance between the competing rights at stake, remained within their margin of appreciation.

It notes that public figures are inevitably and knowingly exposed to public scrutiny and must therefore display a particularly high degree of tolerance (see Milosavljević v. Serbia, no. 57574/14, § 59, 25 May 2021, with further references). Moreover, politicians must be aware that political invective often spills over into the personal sphere; such are the hazards of politics and the free debate of ideas, which are the guarantees of a democratic society (see Lopes Gomes da Silva v. Portugal, no. 37698/97, § 34, ECHR 2000-X, and Mladina d.d. Ljubljana v.

The Court observes in this connection that the publication and comparison of the family photographs at the centre of the present case faced criticism in Slovenia from, among others, certain representatives of the journalistic profession and the Human Rights Ombudsman (see paragraph 11 above), particularly because of the exposure of B.G.’s minor children. However, the issue in the present case is confined to the weighing of the applicant company’s rights against those of B.G. It was the latter’s interests that were directly engaged in the impugned proceedings. By contrast, B.G.’s wife and children were not parties to those proceedings and were awarded compensation in separate domestic proceedings (see paragraph 31 above).", "para_idx": 89}, {"section": "merits", "text": "(ii) Method by which the information was obtained and the circumstances in which the photographs were taken", "para_idx": 90}, {"section": "merits", "text": "65.  The applicant company pointed out that the family photograph of B.G. was taken at a public mass in Brezje on Assumption Day, an event in which the family had actively participated, allowing their photographs to be taken and published in various newspapers (see paragraphs 10 and 38 above). The Court notes that this fact was acknowledged by the Constitutional Court (see paragraph 24 above) and that there is nothing to suggest that a sanction was imposed on the applicant company for merely publishing the photograph. It was rather the use of this photograph in the context of a comparison to the Goebbels family that lead to the interference with the applicant company’s freedom of expression (see paragraph 24 above).", "para_idx": 91}, {"section": "merits", "text": "66.  In this connection the Court also notes that, since B.G. had actively sought the limelight and exposed his family himself (see paragraph 15 above), having regard to the degree to which he was known to the public, his “legitimate expectation” that his private life would be effectively protected was reduced (see Axel Springer AG, cited above, § 101).", "para_idx": 92}, {"section": "merits", "text": "(iii) Contribution to a debate of public interest; form and content of the message conveyed", "para_idx": 93}, {"section": "merits", "text": "67.  The Court reiterates that in the balancing of interests under Articles 8 and 10 of the Convention, the contribution to a debate of general interest made by photographs or articles in the press is an essential criterion (see Rothe, cited above, § 54, and Von Hannover (no. 2), cited above, § 109, with further references).", "para_idx": 94}, {"section": "merits", "text": "68.  It observes that the domestic courts determined that the editorial and the accompanying text above the photographs addressed political issues – specifically, the permissibility of comparing B.G. to Joseph Goebbels and their respective political methods (see paragraphs 6, 15 and 23 above) – and thereby contributed to a debate of public interest. They reached the same conclusion with regard to the subsequent issue of Mladina, which addressed the debate surrounding the impugned publication (see paragraphs 12, 15 and 23 above). The Court agrees with this assessment and attaches particular importance to the fact that the debate surrounding the publication at issue concerned important matters of public concern, such as the methods employed by political parties and the bounds of permissible public criticism in that regard.", "para_idx": 95}, {"section": "merits", "text": "69.  It notes that the comparison of the two photographs in the present case should be characterised as a form of value judgment (see paragraph 15 above), but that such a judgment can prove to be excessive in the absence of any factual basis (see Mladina d.d. Ljubljana, cited above, § 43). In this regard, the Court takes note of the applicant company’s arguments – which the Government did not contest – that it was B.G. himself who had exposed his family to the media in a political context (see paragraph 36 above) and that the criticism underpinning the publication in question related precisely to the political methods employed by B.G. in so exposing his family in order to gain political support (see paragraph 12 above). It therefore cannot be said that the comparison of the photographs – while undoubtedly highly provocative – lacked any factual basis.", "para_idx": 96}, {"section": "merits", "text": "70.  As regards the degree of provocation involved and the comparison’s impact on the reader, the domestic courts appear to have taken the view that the visual comparison went beyond the legitimate matter of public concern and had a greater impact than that of its textual context (see paragraphs 18, 20 and 24 above). In this connection the Court would point out that the form of expression cannot be dissociated from its context and apparent goal (see Grebneva and Alisimchik v. Russia, no. 8918/05, § 62, 22 November 2016), since the question whether a publication concerns an issue of public concern should depend on a broader assessment of the subject matter and the context of the publication (see Tønsbergs Blad A.S. and Haukom v. Norway, no. 510/04, § 87, 1 March 2007). Against this background, the Court considers that, in assessing the present case, due regard should also be had to the following considerations.", "para_idx": 97}, {"section": "merits", "text": "71.  Firstly, apart from the broader context determined by the content referred to above (see paragraphs 23 and 68 above), the title and the short caption placed directly above the photographs (see paragraph 8 above) clearly indicated the political and satirical dimension of their publication.", "para_idx": 98}, {"section": "merits", "text": "72.  Secondly, the impugned photographs were published in the satirical “Mladinamit” section of Mladina (see paragraph 8 above), whose very name, containing the word “dynamite” (see paragraph 4 above), reflects its intentionally provocative and explosive editorial style. The Court cannot accept as convincing the domestic courts’ and the Government’s assertion that the average reader of Mladina would fail to grasp the political context of the photographs in question and the broader message conveyed by them (see paragraphs 20, 24 and 44 above; see also, mutatis mutandis, Nikowitz and Verlagsgruppe News GmbH v. Austria, no. 5266/03, § 25, 22 February 2007, and Wirtschafts‑Trend Zeitschriften-Verlagsgesellschaft mbH v. Austria (no. 3), nos. 66298/01 and 15653/02, § 44, 13 December 2005). While the Court acknowledges that B.G.’s role as a politician and as a father were linked in the photograph (see paragraphs 18 and 24 above), it nonetheless considers that the average reader of Mladina would primarily have perceived B.G. in his role as a politician and the two photographs as a comparison of two politicians and their respective political methods. Indeed, the average reader, when engaging with a satirical publication, will not interpret it literally but will instead take into account its nature as satire, which has humorous elements and naturally aims to provoke and agitate (see Sousa Goucha, cited above, § 50; Grebneva and Alisimchik, cited above, § 59, and Nikowitz and Verlagsgruppe News GmbH, cited above, § 25).", "para_idx": 99}, {"section": "merits", "text": "73.  Thirdly, the Court notes that in considering the “duties and responsibilities” of a journalist, the potential impact of the medium concerned is an important factor and it is commonly acknowledged that the audiovisual media have often a much more immediate and powerful effect than the print media (see Jersild, cited above, § 31, and Murphy, cited above, § 69). In this respect, the Court finds it relevant to note that the publication appeared in a satirical section of a weekly magazine, which deals with political and cultural topics (see paragraph 4 above) and is as such addressed to a specific audience. The photographs were not published in a mainstream press nor disseminated through audiovisual media. They therefore had only a limited impact on the audience and in consequence on B.G.’s reputation – a factor which ought to have been taken into account by the domestic courts (compare with Zemmour v. France, no. 63539/19, § 62, 20 December 2022;  Radio France and Others v. France, no. 53984/00, § 39, ECHR 2004-II, and Animal Defenders International v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 48876/08, § 119, ECHR 2013 (extracts)).", "para_idx": 100}, {"section": "merits", "text": "74.  Lastly, as regards the comparison with the German Nazi regime, the Court notes that comparisons to the German Nazi regime do not automatically justify a conviction for defamation on the ground of the special stigma attached to the latter, especially if there exist special circumstances justifying such a comparison (see Scharsach and News Verlagsgesellschaft v. Austria, no. 39394/98, §§ 43-45, ECHR 2003-XI). Moreover, the Court observes that in Wabl v. Austria (no. 24773/94, 21 March 2000) the term “Nazi” was used without any connection to the underlying debate, whereas in the present case the comparison with the Nazi politician Joseph Goebbels was used precisely to criticise the use, by the SDS party, including B.G., of political methods similar to those of the German Nazi regime, including the exposure of one’s family to political discourse, as emphasised by the applicant company. Finally, it should be remembered that journalistic freedom also includes the possibility of recourse to a certain amount of exaggeration, or even provocation (see Lopes Gomes da Silva, cited above, § 34).", "para_idx": 101}, {"section": "merits", "text": "(iv) Consequences of the publication", "para_idx": 102}, {"section": "merits", "text": "75.  As to the consequences of the publication in question, the Court notes that none of the domestic courts pointed to any specific negative impact or effects the publication might have had for B.G. but focused rather on the consequences for his family’s reputation. However, the Court notes that B.G.’s family members received compensation on account of the impugned publication. Even assuming that B.G.’s own reputation suffered as a result of the articles in question, it has not been demonstrated that the consequences suffered by him were sufficiently serious to override the public’s interest in receiving the information contained in them (see, mutatis mutandis, Pricope v. Romania, no. 60183/17, § 58, 30 May 2023, and Stancu and Others v. Romania, no. 22953/16, § 147, 18 October 2022).", "para_idx": 103}, {"section": "merits", "text": "(v) Conclusion", "para_idx": 104}, {"section": "merits", "text": "76.  The Court reiterates that, in the present case, the domestic courts were called upon to balance the applicant company’s rights against those of B.G., and not against those of B.G.’s family members, who had already obtained compensation in separate domestic proceedings (see paragraphs 31 and 64 above). Having regard to this and to the other considerations set above, the Court finds that domestic courts did not sufficiently take into account the broader context in which the impugned publication was made, including the prior lively debate about B.G. and his political methods on social media, its limited effect on the audience of Mladina and its publication in the highly satirical section of the magazine (see paragraphs 4 and 72 above).", "para_idx": 105}, {"section": "merits", "text": "77.  It follows that the domestic courts failed to establish convincingly any pressing social need for placing the protection of B.G.’s reputation above the applicant company’s right to freedom of expression and the general interest in promoting freedom of expression where issues of public interest are concerned. This conclusion cannot be affected by the fact that the proceedings complained of were civil rather than criminal in nature (see Zybertowicz v. Poland, no. 59138/10, § 48, 17 January 2017, and Mladina d.d.

Priority within the category of sexual offences was based on an assessment of the danger of evidence being lost and the effect delays may otherwise have on the evidentiary status of the case. The introduction of digital investigation plans in 2018 and the reorganisation of the RMP into specialised investigation teams ensured that sexual offence cases were investigated by specialists within a systematic and thorough framework (see paragraphs 69-71 above).

The assessment involved weighing all evidence in context, which was standard practice in criminal proceedings.

The Government denied that the delays in these cases were due to their nature as sexual offences.

In all four cases, the delays were linked to resource constraints and the timing of the complaints, but they did not impair the efficiency of investigation or prejudice the outcome.

The delay in questioning did not afford K. any special opportunity to prepare because the complaint was lodged almost two months after the events, by which time both R.E. and K. had discussed the incident on more than one occasion, as well as with colleagues. K. had therefore already known of the allegations of sexual assault, while he had not known that formal charges had been filed until he was summoned for questioning. In total, six witnesses were interviewed, five of whom were identified by R.E. The police concluded that other potential witnesses could not add anything material beyond what had already been stated.

In the absence of any contemporaneous medical evidence, blood alcohol levels could not be determined to support Y’s account of events.

The Government also submitted that although Children’s House records and medical records casting light on the psychological effects of the incident on Y were not obtained, their nature was known and would not have altered the evidentiary balance in the case. While evidence of psychological consequences was relevant to assessing the credibility of the victim’s account of events and was frequently obtained and relied on for that purpose, its significance varied depending on context.

The Government submitted that R. had not acknowledged sexual violence in his social media interactions with S.O. In any case, the investigators had asked him specific questions about their exchange. As to the supporting evidence cited by S.O., the witness statements and psychological reports had been considered but could not overcome the evidentiary difficulty presented by contradictory accounts of the central events.

Any legal or prosecutorial approach that requires proof of physical resistance risks failing to protect sexual autonomy and enabling impunity.

The explanatory material to the 2007 amendment highlighted that the essential element of a sexual offence was the occurrence of sexual relations without the victim’s consent (see paragraph 59 above). The 2018 amendments to Article 194 placed a more explicit emphasis on consent by defining rape in terms of the absence of freely given consent and by clarifying that complete inactivity does not signify willingness to participate (see paragraphs 60-61 above). This does not, however, indicate that the previous legal framework, which was in force at the time of the alleged assaults in the first two cases, was inadequate, as evidenced by the case-law of the Icelandic superior courts applying the 2007 text in a consent-based manner (see paragraphs 65-66 above).", "para_idx": 129}, {"section": "merits", "text": "115.  Article 195 of the GPC provides for increased punishment where aggravating circumstances are present.

By the time the investigation was opened, S.O. had already recounted the events to her friends and family and exchanged communications with both suspects, in which her accusations and their responses were recorded. Any possibility of coordinating their positions therefore pre-dated the formal investigation.

Against this background, the lapse of around two and a half months between the suspects’ interviews cannot be regarded as giving rise to a real and immediate risk of collusion of the kind previously identified in the Court’s case-law on police violence. Therefore, the decisive issue was not whether the authorities acted to prevent collusion in the immediate aftermath of the complaint, but whether they pursued the case with reasonable diligence once it had been brought to their attention.

The Court observes that Iceland ranks highly in international assessments of gender equality and has undertaken numerous reforms aimed at addressing sexual violence, including the 2007 and 2018 legislative amendments to Article 194 of the GPC, the establishment of specialised investigation structures and the introduction of prioritisation mechanisms (see paragraphs 59-61 and 67-71 above). Throughout the relevant period, Iceland maintained both a substantive and procedural system capable, in principle, of providing effective protection against sexual violence (see paragraphs 114-117).

Although the international monitoring bodies identified areas for improvement and reported concerns voiced by NGOs about enforcement and a “rather conservative” interpretation of consent, they acknowledged a robust consent-based framework and ongoing reforms and did not document institutional stereotyping of the kind at issue (see paragraphs 76, 79 and 80 above).", "para_idx": 193}, {"section": "merits", "text": "158.  The applicants relied on data from the State Prosecutor’s annual reports to demonstrate lower prosecution and conviction rates in sexual-violence cases with the implication that those figures should be read as indicating a pattern of ineffective investigation and prosecution of sexual offences against women. However, for the reasons set out in B.A. v. Iceland (cited above, §§ 92-96), the Court finds that such data must be interpreted with considerable caution. Lower prosecution rates may be explained by objective factors unrelated to discriminatory attitudes, as sexual violence cases present inherent evidentiary challenges that affect prosecution rates without necessarily reflecting discrimination. Moreover, the statistics do not establish that cases involving male victims are treated differently by the authorities.

Prioritising knowledge of the language over educational considerations increased the risk of employing people who preached a more radical form of Islam.

According to the journalist, that background could lead them to misinterpret religious messages, potentially resulting in their conversion to jihadism.

These were the demands of pluralism, tolerance and broadmindedness without which there was no “democratic society”. As set out in Article 10, this freedom is subject to exceptions, which must, however, be construed strictly, and the need for any restrictions must be established convincingly (the appellate court cited Handyside v. the United Kingdom, 7 December 1976, § 49, Series A no. 24; Éditions Plon v. France, no. 58148/00, § 42, ECHR 2004-IV, and Lindon, Otchakovsky-Laurens and July v. France [GC], nos. 21279/02 and 36448/02, § 45, ECHR 2007-IV).", "para_idx": 44}, {"section": "facts_proceedings", "text": "30.  The appellate court found that the article in the present case was not a neutral report, because it contained the journalist’s opinions and evaluation of the situation and was not confined to merely relaying others’ statements.

The article also highlighted concerns raised by the authorities about employment practices in those centres and the lack of administrative filters. There was widespread concern about immigrant integration and the education of vulnerable minors, especially when terrorism was under discussion. Therefore, the appellate court found the subject of the article to be of great public interest. It found that, although the article “mixed freedom of information and freedom of expression”, the former clearly prevailed.

It referred instead, in general terms, to “Islamic fundamentalism”. Contrary to the applicants’ allegation that an ordinary (“street”) person would directly associate fundamentalism with violence and terrorism, that term  as rightly noted by the first-instance court  only referred to strands of Islam based on a literal or orthodox reading of the religious texts. The scope of the right to freedom of information could not be restricted by erroneous interpretations of individual words. The court also found nothing in the text of the article to support the applicants’ argument that it included accusations that they had incited people to hatred or violence. Having considered the term “indoctrination” and referring to its definition in a Spanish academic dictionary, the court found that transmitting ideas or beliefs “or a strand of religion based on the literal reading of sacred texts” could not be considered insulting (the court referred again to the centre’s activities including the celebration of Ramadan and visiting a mosque).

The journalist had duly checked the information. In addition to his extensive experience in terrorism issues and his sources in the Ministry of the Interior, he had checked the information with the Generalitat and had attempted to verify it further with the centre itself, although they had not answered his phone call.

That legitimate preventative purpose, which was independent of redress for the damage caused by publishing inaccurate information, would often be thwarted by delays in carrying out the intended rectification (§ 4 of the Legal Grounds).

To reach this conclusion, the Constitutional Court noted that in cases where the issue was not only giving information but also supporting a news item or an opinion expressed by third parties, it was relevant if incomplete information had been subsequently corrected. While the right to rectify information did not replace the protection of the right to one’s reputation or render it unnecessary, it did mitigate damage.

The Supreme Court found that the content of the report corresponded with the results of the police investigation into a specific meeting held by radical Islamists, as those results stood at the time of publication. The reported information was not completely untrue or lacking in factual basis, as the news source was credible, serious and reliable, and it was unnecessary to verify anything other than the accuracy of the source.

The requirement under the Constitution for published information to be truthful does not mean there is no protection for erroneous information. Rather, it puts a duty of diligence on journalists, who must check their facts against objective information before publishing. The requirement of accuracy (truthfulness) is therefore met when, before publishing, a reporter carries out an investigation into the facts being reported with the diligence required of an information professional.

Similarly, none of the statements made about the second applicant were insulting, humiliating or offensive to the extent of damaging their reputation. Secondly, the Government argued that, contrary to the applicants’ submissions that the article had had a devastating effect on their professional prospects, the article had had no noticeable impact on the applicants’ professional lives. Disciplinary proceedings were initiated against only one applicant, contrary to their claim, and were discontinued within a week. That remained the only effect of the publication, and otherwise the two applicants continued to work at the centre for minors after the article was published. Only some time later was the centre closed for financial reasons, resulting in their dismissal. The Government therefore saw no link between the publication and the applicants’ job loss. The Government also referred to the applicants’ employment records and their submissions to the domestic courts and argued that after the closure of the centre the first applicant had continued to be employed part-time with the university, and since 2016 he had been employed with associations operating in the area of teaching, or the care of vulnerable minors and individuals in need of social protection (see paragraph 43 above); and that the second applicant had been successfully employed with another centre for minors until he moved to Belgium in 2014 (see paragraph 44 above).

If the ABC had refused, the applicants could have initiated correction (right of reply) proceedings. As these proceedings are swift, the applicants could have obtained a public correction of the information within a very short period of time, also preventing access to it via the internet thereafter. The Constitutional Court in its rulings (notably, no. 168/1986 of 22 December 1986, see paragraph 54 above) had highlighted the preventative nature of rectification proceedings, as they allowed a person affected by false or inaccurate information to avoid the damage caused by the publication of that information (they also referred to the Constitutional Court’s findings in judgment no. 40/1992 of 30 March 1992, see paragraph 55 above). Additionally, the Government noted that the applicants could have made use of their “right to be forgotten” as provided for by section 93 of the Institutional Law no. 3/2018 (see paragraph 63 above), which meant they could have had the article removed from search engine results for their names.

The relevant part of the article stated that the applicants, who were identified by their full names, had exposed minors in the centre they worked at to religious indoctrination aligned with Islamist fundamentalist ideologies; that one of them had taken pupils to a specific mosque associated with historical Islamic figures; and that another one was affiliated with a group stated to be known for its radical views.

The Court further notes the Constitutional Court’s clarification that a judge in right of reply proceedings did not have to determine whether either the published facts or those contained in the reply were true. A judicial decision granting an application for the right of reply did not necessarily mean that the version of the facts presented by the complainant was correct, and the ruling of a court in right of reply proceedings did not make the issue res judicata if there were subsequently proceedings which included an examination of the facts (see, for the relevant Ruling, also cited by the Government, paragraph 54 above). Similarly, in Ediciones Tiempo v. Spain (no. 13010/87, Commission decision of 12 July 1989, Decisions and Reports 62, p. 247) the Commission observed that since a reply, to be effective, needs to be published immediately, the accuracy of the facts asserted in the reply cannot be checked in any great detail at the time of the publication. That led the former European Commission of Human Rights to go on to note that the applicant company in that case could bring other forms of civil or criminal action in order to obtain a ruling on whether the information was accurate through the ordinary judicial process.

Special grounds are therefore required before the media can be dispensed from their ordinary obligation to verify factual statements that are defamatory of private individuals.

The article highlighted the vulnerability of the foreign minors concerned, which made them especially susceptible to manipulation and indoctrination.

The Supreme Court, for its part, found that allegations of indoctrinating pupils in a particular strand of Islam by taking them to pray in a particular mosque and allegations that the applicants belonged to a radical strand of Islam were not in themselves allegations of reprehensible or dishonourable conduct (see paragraph 41 above). The Court finds it relevant that, as found by the first-instance and the appeal courts, the article did not accuse the educators of indoctrinating minors in the practice of jihad or of encouraging them to participate in violent acts.", "para_idx": 143}, {"section": "merits", "text": "104.  As regards the heading, sub-headings, overall tone and context of the article and the overall impact that the information presented in association with the applicants’ names might have had on a reader, the Court reiterates that freedom of expression “is applicable not only to “information” or “ideas” that are favourably received or regarded as inoffensive or as a matter of indifference, but also to those that “offend, shock or disturb” (see Morice, cited above, § 161, with further references; De Haes and Gijsels v. Belgium, 24 February 1997, § 46, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-I, 24 February 1997, nº42, and Benitez Moriana and Iñigo Fernandez v. Spain, nos. 36537/15 and 36539/15, § 55, 9 March 2021). Furthermore, it is not for the Court, any more than it is for the national courts, to substitute its own views for those of the press as to the techniques of reporting which should be adopted in a particular case (see, among other authorities, Von Hannover, cited above, § 102). In any event, the Court finds that the journalist had an obligation to provide a sufficient factual basis in so far as the article contained specific statements concerning the applicants (see, mutatis mutandis, Polanco Torres and Movilla Polanco v. Spain, no. 34147/06, § 47, 21 September 2010; see further, in so far as relevant, Morice, cited above, § 157).

The Court observes that the Supreme Court analysed the case in terms of journalistic diligence and the accuracy of the reported facts, just as the first-instance court had previously. The domestic courts observed that the article contained a direct reference to information from Department of Social Action and Citizenship of the local government (Generalitat), which, in turn, had received data from the centre for minors itself.", "para_idx": 145}, {"section": "merits", "text": "106.  The Court reiterates that the domestic courts are better placed to assess relevant evidence and sees no reason to depart from their findings that the journalist based his allegations on information obtained from reliable official sources. The Court reiterates in this respect that journalists must be free to report on events based on information gathered from official sources without having to check them. The press should normally be entitled to rely on the content of official reports without having to undertake independent research (see Axel Springer AG v. Germany [GC], no. 39954/08, § 105, 7 February 2012; Yordanova and Toshev v. Bulgaria, no. 5126/05, § 51, 2 October 2012; Mesić, cited above § 66; and Colombani and Others v. France, no. 51297/99, § 65, ECHR 2002‑V).", "para_idx": 146}, {"section": "merits", "text": "107.  The Court further reiterates that the protection of journalistic sources is one of the cornerstones of freedom of the press. Without that protection, sources may be deterred from assisting the press in informing the public about matters of public interest. As a result, the vital public-watchdog role of the press may be undermined, and the ability of the press to provide accurate and reliable information may be adversely affected (see, among other authorities, Goodwin v. the United Kingdom, 27 March 1996, § 39, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996‑II, and Sanoma Uitgevers B.V. v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 38224/03, § 50, 14 September 2010).", "para_idx": 147}, {"section": "merits", "text": "108.  The Court also sees no reason in the applicant’s submissions or the case material to depart from the domestic courts’ findings that the journalist had attempted to contact the centre for minors to obtain their version of events, but without success. With regard to the applicants’ argument concerning the denial by unspecified employees of the centre of any contact with the journalist (see paragraph 10 above for the letter of the director of the centre and paragraph 82 above for the applicants’ argument), the Court observes that the article essentially states that the source was the local authority, which had previously received the information from the centre itself. This does not mean that the journalist did not make a further call to the centre to check the information, as he stated in the domestic proceedings. Further, the applicants’ reference to the Consortium of Social Services of Barcelona’s denying any contact with the journalist, as well as the Consortium’s expression of full support for the applicants (see paragraph 82 above), appears misplaced. In support of that argument, they only submitted to the Court a letter from the centre’s management to the Consortium. The letter summarises the measures taken by the centre for minors as a follow-up to the publication of the article (see paragraph 10 above), but does not contain the Consortium’s opinion, if any, on the matter.", "para_idx": 148}, {"section": "merits", "text": "109.  In sum, the Court sees no reason to depart from the domestic courts’ findings that the journalist displayed the required diligence in checking the information concerning the applicants before publishing it (see, mutatis mutandis, Polanco Torres and Movilla Polanco, cited above, §§ 50-51). The Court reiterates that if the national courts apply an overly rigorous approach to the assessment of journalists’ professional conduct, journalists could be unduly deterred from discharging their function of keeping the public informed. The courts must therefore take into account the likely impact of their rulings not only on the individual cases before them but also on the media in general (see Yordanova and Toshev v. Bulgaria, cited above, § 55, with further references). The Court further considers that the expressions used by the journalist, although quite strong, had a sufficiently close connection with the facts of the case, and that his remarks could not be regarded as misleading or as a gratuitous attack (see Morice, cited above, § 161).", "para_idx": 149}, {"section": "merits", "text": "(v)    The consequences of the publication", "para_idx": 150}, {"section": "merits", "text": "110.  The Court accepts that the article was disseminated by one of the largest national daily newspapers (see paragraph 15 above for the information concerning the daily circulation provided by the applicants in the domestic proceedings). Furthermore, the article also became (and still is) accessible on the newspaper’s website, which has a considerable number of daily visitors. The Court also notes that the article appears to no longer be searchable by the applicants’ names (see paragraph 46 above), although at what point that began is unclear. However, it has not been disputed a search under the applicants’ names would result in the article at least as late as 2015, when the applicants commenced their civil claim in the domestic courts.", "para_idx": 151}, {"section": "merits", "text": "111.  As regards the consequences of the publication, the Court notes that the applicants consistently emphasised, both in the domestic proceedings and before the Court, that they had been unable to find employment as social educators as a result of the publication.", "para_idx": 152}, {"section": "merits", "text": "112.  However, those allegations find no support in the case material. Having found that the matter as such attracted protection of Article 8 for the reasons stated in paragraph 71 above, the Court is nonetheless unable to uphold the applicants’ allegations that their professional lives were derailed by the disputed ABC publication, as they suggested. On the contrary, it notes that, as demonstrated by the Government, both applicants continued to work at the centre for minors for several months after the article was published, before being dismissed in May 2012 when the centre closed (see paragraph 11 above). It appears that the employer expressed its full support for them (see paragraph 10 above), and so did several of their colleagues (see paragraph 9 above). After the closure of the centre, the second applicant continued to be employed by another educational organisation for minors until 2014, when he moved to Belgium (see paragraphs 18 and 44 above). It appears that the first applicant pursued his academic career and had a history of employment in the field of social education and care of minors after the article was published (see paragraph 43 above).", "para_idx": 153}, {"section": "merits", "text": "113.  Additionally, the Court observes that the applicants brought their civil claim in the domestic courts four years after the publication of the article. It has been suggested that they had hoped to obtain a remedy for the prejudice they had suffered within criminal proceedings (see paragraphs 12‑13 above), but the Court observes that they took no steps between early March 2013, when their criminal complaint was dismissed, and September 2015, the date of commencement of their civil action (see paragraph 14 above). Although this delay is irrelevant to the analysis of the admissibility of the complaint before the Court, the applicants’ submissions regarding the immediate and lasting detrimental effect of the publication appear to be somewhat inconsistent with the significant time that elapsed before they took any procedural steps to seek protection of their reputation.", "para_idx": 154}, {"section": "merits", "text": "(vi)  Conclusion", "para_idx": 155}, {"section": "merits", "text": "114.  In the light of the above, the Court finds that the domestic courts acted within their margin of appreciation when seeking to establish a balance between the applicants’ rights under Article 8 and the newspaper’s opposing right to freedom of expression under Article 10.

Thirdly, the person affected must be able, if need be with appropriate legal advice, to foresee the consequences of the domestic law for him, and fourthly, the domestic law must be compatible with the rule of law (see, among other authorities, De Tommaso v.

It is the practical interpretation and application of the law by the domestic courts that must give individuals protection against arbitrary interference (see Italgomme Pneumatici S.r.l. and Others v.

The Court, ruling under Article 46 of the Convention, therefore called upon the Respondent State to adopt a series of general measures aimed at reforming the system for resolving football disputes (ibid., § 242).

It reiterates that, subject to monitoring by the Committee of Ministers, the respondent State remains free to choose the means by which it will discharge its legal obligation under Article 46 of the Convention, provided that such means are compatible with the conclusions set out in the Court’s judgment. For its part, the Court cannot assume any role in this dialogue (Lyons and Others v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 15227/03, ECHR 2003 - IX). Consequently, it would not consider that a State had violated the Convention because it had not taken one or another of those measures in the execution of one of its judgments (see, for example, Moreira Ferreira v. Portugal (no. 2) [GC], no. 19867/12, § 102, 11 July 2017).", "para_idx": 132}, {"section": "article_46", "text": "33.  However, the Committee of Ministers’ role in the sphere of execution of the Court’s judgments does not prevent the Court from examining a new application concerning measures taken by a respondent State in the context of executing a previous judgment, where that application contains relevant new information relating to issues undecided by the initial judgment (see, Verein gegen Tierfabriken Schweiz (VgT) v. Switzerland (no. 2) [GC], no. 32772/02, § 62, ECHR 2009, and the United Macedonian Organisation Ilinden – PIRIN and Others v.

The applicant further argued that, in practice, the Arbitration Committee continued to be dependent on the Board of Directors. He submitted that both in 2022, after the amendments in question had come into effect, and in 2024, when a new Board of Directors had been elected by the Congress, the newly elected presidents of the TFF had made public calls requiring all TFF committee members, including the Arbitration Committee to resign (see paragraphs 14 – 15 above).

However, when arbitration is compulsory, in the sense of being required by law and parties having no option but to refer their dispute to an arbitral tribunal, as was the case here, the arbitral tribunal must afford the safeguards secured by Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (see Ali Rıza and Others, cited above, §§ 173-74 with further references, and more recently, Semenya v.

The representatives of football clubs still make up the majority of the Congress, which elects the Board of Directors. More importantly, the Board of Directors continues to appoint the members of the Arbitration Committee. However, the mere fact that its members are appointed by the Board of Directors is not sufficient to cast doubt on its objective impartiality. In this connection, the Court reiterates that the appointment of members of a tribunal by the executive is not, in itself, incompatible with the Convention, as is the election or appointment of judges by the executive or the legislature (see Zolotas v. Greece, no. 38240/02, § 24, 2 June 2005, and Guðmundur Andri Ástráðsson v. Iceland [GC], no. 26374/18, § 207, 1 December 2020). What the Convention requires is that the appointment procedure be free from undue political influence and that, once elected or appointed, members of a tribunal remain independent and free from any pressure in the exercise of their judicial functions (see, for example, Guðmundur Andri Ástráðsson, cited above, § 207; Xero Flor w Polsce sp. z o.o. v. Poland, no. 4907/18, § 252, 7 May 2021; Reczkowicz v. Poland, no. 43447/19, § 276, 22 July 2021; and Dolińska-Ficek and Ozimek v. Poland, nos. 49868/19 and 57511/19, § 349, 8 November 2021). In the specific context of sports-related disputes and compulsory arbitration proceedings such as the one at issue here, the requirements of independence and absence of undue influence must also be assessed having regard to the particular institutional framework in which the arbitral tribunals operate. In the present case, there is nothing to suggest that the appointment process was tainted by undue political influence. The Court further notes that the applicant did not claim that the members of the Arbitration Committee had received instructions or had been subject to any pressure from the Board of Directors when deciding on his individual case. Nor is it possible to discern such instructions or pressure from the case file.

The Court reiterates that it found the previous legislation which had limited the term of office of the members of the Arbitration Committee to that of the Board of Directors, thus aligning their tenure with that of the executive body of the TFF, to call into question the requirement that a tribunal be independent and impartial (Ali Rıza and Others, cited above, § 213). While the current legislation appears to remedy this shortcoming by detaching the term of office of the Arbitration Committee from that of the Board of Directors, the Court notes that in practice this has not proven to serve as an adequate guarantee. In that connection, the Court notes that, while the relevant legislative amendment provided that the current serving members of the Arbitration Committee would continue to serve their four-year term (see paragraph 19 above), following a public call by the newly elected TFF president for the resignation of committee members, all TFF committees, including the members of the Arbitration Committee, handed in their resignation (see paragraph 14 above).

Following that public call, the Arbitration Committee members resigned once more, and the Board of Directors proceeded to appoint new members, who took office on 25 July 2024. Those developments occurring in the course of two elections taking place after the legislative amendments came into effect, and despite the fact that the sitting members’ term of office had not expired and legislation provided that they should serve their full term independently from the term of office of the Board of Directors, reveal a persistent and troubling pattern, whereby the executive bodies of the TFF, upon being elected, seek to replace committee members with individuals of their own choosing. This practice gives rise to legitimate doubts as to the independence and impartiality of the Arbitration Committee.", "para_idx": 146}, {"section": "article_46", "text": "43.  The Court reiterates that the Convention is intended to guarantee rights that are “practical and effective” rather than theoretical and illusory (see Perdigão v.

Accordingly, while the Court welcomes the legislative amendment detaching the term of office of Arbitration Committee members from that of the Board of Directors, it is not convinced that this measure has proved effective in practice in ensuring the Committee’s structural independence from the Board of Directors. Nevertheless, it will continue to examine, as it did in Ali Rıza and Others (cited above, §§ 212-22 and 241-42), whether sufficient safeguards existed in practice shielding the members of the Arbitration Committee against external influence or pressure.", "para_idx": 147}, {"section": "article_46", "text": "(iii)   Composition of the Arbitration Committee", "para_idx": 148}, {"section": "article_46", "text": "44.  The Court notes that in Ali Rıza and Others (cited above, § 212) it considered the fact that the Arbitration Committee was exclusively composed of lay assessors to be unproblematic. This finding still holds true for the present case. The Court further notes that the legislative amendments have strengthened the professional and ethical standards required of the members. In particular, members are now required to have at least ten years of professional experience as opposed to five in the previous legislation. Moreover, the new rules provide that at least one member should have judicial and prosecutorial experience and another member should be from academia, with preference given to candidates holding postgraduate qualifications in law or sports law (see paragraphs 18 and 20-21 above).", "para_idx": 149}, {"section": "article_46", "text": "45.  Most importantly, the amended framework introduced several disqualification criteria designed to strengthen impartiality and prevent conflicts of interest. Individuals are precluded from becoming members if they have previously held office in one of the TFF’s committees for more than eight years; if they are members of football clubs or have shares or work in their management or audit department; or if they are presently serving in the executive bodies of the TFF (see paragraphs 20-21 above). The Court considers that these revised eligibility criteria represent an improvement in the institutional safeguards governing the composition of the Arbitration Committee.", "para_idx": 150}, {"section": "article_46", "text": "(iv)  Immunity from legal action", "para_idx": 151}, {"section": "article_46", "text": "46.  In Ali Rıza and Others (cited above) the Court noted that the Arbitration Committee, whose composition included only lay assessors, were not immune from any legal action which might be brought against them in connection with the discharge of their duties (ibid., § 212). The amended law has introduced a new provision which expressly provides that no legal action may be brought against the members of the Arbitration Committee, except in cases of serious fault such as gross negligence or gross misconduct (see paragraph 20 above).", "para_idx": 152}, {"section": "article_46", "text": "47.  The Court notes that this new provision offers a preliminary level of protection by prohibiting legal action against committee members unless they are found to have committed a serious fault. In the present dispute, the Court notes at the outset that no specific complaint has been raised as to whether the provision governing the liability of members of the Arbitration Committee has, in practice, had consequences that would weaken their position vis-à-vis the parties. However, since the Court is called upon to assess the adequacy of the safeguards against external pressures, and bearing in mind that the system at issue is one of State-mandated compulsory arbitration, it considers it helpful to compare, to the extent necessary and appropriate, the protection afforded to members of the Arbitration Committee with that granted to judges in respect of acts performed in the discharge of their duties. It notes in this regard that comparable provisions in domestic law governing the legal liability of judges expressly specify that, even in cases of serious fault, legal action may only be brought against the State and not against the individual judge (see paragraph 22 above). Moreover, these provisions set out exclusive and specific grounds of liability and establish a time-limit within which the State may exercise its right of recourse against the responsible judge. As it currently stands, however, the provision governing the liability of Arbitration Committee members offers only limited protection, as it leaves them personally exposed to legal proceedings, without any comparably short and clear temporal limitation (see, mutatis mutandis, Oleksandr Volkov v. Ukraine, no. 21722/11, § 139, ECHR 2013) and without the clearly defined grounds for which they may be held liable.

Under the post-2022 legislative framework which was applicable in the present case, the members are now required to disclose any relationship or interest that could potentially give rise to a conflict of interest before taking office and make a solemn declaration to avoid such conflicts during their term and to carry out their duties in accordance with the principles of independence and impartiality.", "para_idx": 155}, {"section": "article_46", "text": "49.  While it appears that the members are still not formally bound by a codified set of professional rules of conduct, the introduction and content of the solemn declaration made by the members before taking up their duties, which includes the duty to disclose and to refrain from any conflict of interest, constitute a significant improvement and adequately address the concerns expressed by the Court in that regard and therefore appear to be satisfactory.", "para_idx": 156}, {"section": "article_46", "text": "(vi)  Procedure and mechanism to decide on recusal requests", "para_idx": 157}, {"section": "article_46", "text": "50.  The amended legislation requires any member of the Arbitration Committee to refrain from sitting in a case which may raise a conflict of interest (see paragraph 20 above). This represents a significant improvement on the previous legislation (see Ali Rıza and Others, cited above, § 215). However, the current rules remain deficient in one important respect. They do not establish a clear procedure to be followed in cases where the challenge to the independence or impartiality of a member of the Arbitration Committee comes from one of parties in the dispute. Also, it is still not clear which body is competent to decide in the event where a challenge to one or more members of the Committee is raised by the parties in the proceedings.", "para_idx": 158}, {"section": "article_46", "text": "51.  The rules do not specify in this regard whether the remaining members of the Arbitration Committee would decide on recusal requests given that there exists no appeal body in the TFF’s system to the decisions rendered by the Arbitration Committee.

However, it considers that the provisions regulating the legal liability of the Committee members and the recusal procedure, when members are challenged by the parties, do not entirely satisfy the standards required by the Convention, as identified in Ali Rıza and Others (cited above, §§ 212 and 215). Moreover, despite the legislative reforms adopted at the TFF level, the practice demonstrates that the four-year term of office of the members is not respected in reality. The Arbitration Committee continues to be reconstituted whenever there is a new election at the executive level of the TFF, thereby justifying the fear that the Arbitration Committee lacks independence and impartiality.

As a result, he had had to leave his family, who had been living in Izmir for many years, and move to the city of Iskenderun which had been devastated by an earthquake on 6 February 2023.

In this sense Article 8 may also extend to professional activities (see Platini v. Switzerland (dec.), no. 526/18, § 52, 11 February 2020 with further references). The general principles concerning the applicability of Article 8 of the Convention in this context were set out in Denisov (cited above, §§ 92-117). In particular, the Court held that such disputes were not per se excluded from the scope of “private life” within the meaning of Article 8 of the Convention. There are some typical aspects of private life which may be affected in such disputes by dismissal, demotion, non-admission to a profession or other similarly unfavourable measures. These aspects include: (i) the applicant’s “inner circle”; (ii) the applicant’s opportunity to establish and develop relationships with others; and (iii) the applicant’s social and professional reputation. There are two ways in which a private-life issue would usually arise in such a dispute: either because of the underlying reasons for the impugned measure (reason-based approach) or – in certain cases – because of the consequences for private life (consequence-based approach). If the latter approach is at stake, the threshold of severity with respect to all the above-mentioned aspects assumes crucial importance. It is for the applicant to show convincingly that the threshold was attained in his or her case. The applicant must present evidence substantiating the consequences of the impugned measure. The Court will only accept that Article 8 is applicable where these consequences are very serious and affect his or her private life to a very significant degree.", "para_idx": 171}, {"section": "article_46", "text": "61.  In the present case, the Board of Directors’ decision not to revoke the termination notice filed accidentally by the applicant’s lawyer was not based on reasons or factors relating to the applicant’s private life.

In any event, the Board of Directors’ refusal to revoke the termination notice did not prevent the applicant from signing with another football club, which he indeed did.

The Court considers it appropriate to clarify at the outset that the scope of the complaint before it is limited to the CROC’s decision not to confirm her assignments in question and does not concern the compensation claim, in so far as the latter which had been raised in the context of another complaint was declared inadmissible at the stage of communication of the application by the President of the Section acting as a single judge.", "para_idx": 133}, {"section": "admissibility", "text": "52.  Having clarified the scope of the complaint, the Court must next examine whether Article 6 § 1 of the Convention applied to the dispute arising out of the CROC’s discretionary decision not to confirm the applicant’s participation in the international tournaments, despite her being an FIVB‑level international referee and having received official invitations from the organisers of those events.

Thus, where the superior national courts have analysed in a comprehensive and convincing manner the precise nature of the impugned restriction of access to a court, on the basis of the relevant Convention case-law and principles drawn therefrom, the Court would need strong reasons to differ from the conclusion reached by those courts by substituting its own views for theirs on a question of interpretation of domestic law and by finding, unlike them, that the person concerned arguably had a right recognised by domestic law (see Grzęda, cited above, § 259, with further references).", "para_idx": 136}, {"section": "admissibility", "text": "55.  In carrying out this assessment, it is necessary to look beyond appearances and the language used and to concentrate on the realities of the situation (see Roche v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 32555/96, § 121, ECHR 2005‑X, and Boulois v.

This is true of certain decisions where the authorities have a purely discretionary power to grant or refuse an advantage or privilege, and where the law confers on the person concerned the right to apply to the courts, which may set the decision aside if they find that it was unlawful.

The CROC’s decision in the present case not to confirm the applicant’s assignment to several international matches did not affect the applicant’s standing as an international referee or her rank or ability to referee matches in the national leagues.

Moreover, it appears from the correspondence between the FIVB officials and the applicant that, at least in practice, the FIVB did require the national federation to approve assignments (see paragraph 15 above and also paragraph 45 where the FIVB regulations requires the national federation to register referees on its VIS system). The domestic regulations in turn give the CROC discretion to decide which referees are put on the list and can therefore be assigned to the matches. However, that discretion does not appear to be entirely unlimited and so does not preclude the engagement of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. Section 29 of the Referee and Observer Directive requires the CROC to take a number of criteria for the performance of referees into account in coming to its decision (see paragraph 43 above). It has not been argued by the Government that the applicant failed to fulfil any of the criteria. In fact, the Government underlined that the decision in question was not based on the applicant’s performance at all. That being the case, the Court observes that the CROC gave very limited reasons as to why the applicant, Türkiye’s first female international beach volleyball referee and one with a strong performance record, was excluded from the list.

Although the part of the complaint before the Court concerns whether the Sports Arbitration Board fulfilled the requirements of an independent and impartial tribunal - a question that may be examined provided that Article 6 applies - for the purposes of analysing of that provision, it suffices to note that the Sports Arbitration Board, which has the power to issue binding, final and enforceable decisions, examined the present dispute and did not reject it on the basis that it was outside its remit.

She claimed that it did not have full jurisdiction to determine a dispute on the basis of legal rules. She presented two further arguments as to why the Sports Arbitration Board did not qualify as an independent and impartial tribunal within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. Firstly, the Sports Arbitration Board was not independent from the executive, as its members were appointed by the Ministry upon the proposal of the Ministry’s General Director of Sports. The applicant underlined that apart from the members having to satisfy certain educational and professional requirements, there were no criteria for appointment to the Board. This meant that the Ministry had unfettered discretion as to whom to appoint, and even the Ministry staff or members or employees of sports federations could be appointed. The applicant observed that one of the members of the panel that had decided her case had previously been a staff director at the Ministry, and had since returned to work there as the Ministry’s General Director of Legal Services. Another member who had sat on the panel deciding her case was a former member of a Board of Executives that represented several sports federations (Bocce bowling and Dart and skateboard, respectively). Secondly, the Sports Arbitration Board did not appear to be independent and impartial as the General Director at the Ministry appointed 10% of all members of the Congress of the TVF, which in turned elected members of the Board of Directors that had taken the final decision against her and had been her opponent in the disputed proceedings. The Ministry and its General Director had a significant influence on decision-making processes in many amateur and semi-professional sports federations in Türkiye, unlike the situation in football. There were therefore no safeguards to protecting the Sports Arbitration Board from outside pressures. The applicant referred to the Court’s observations about the Turkish Football Federation’s Arbitration Committee to the effect that its members were not immune from any action which might be brought against them in connection with their discharging their duties. They were not bound by any rules of professional conduct and did not have to swear an oath or make a solemn declaration before taking up their duties, and there was no procedure for dealing with challenges to individual members of the Arbitration Committee.

Referring to separate regulations governing the appointment, retention and functions of the members of the Sports Arbitration Board, the Government observed that the most important guarantee of independence and impartiality was that the tenure of the appointed members was set out in law and that the Minister had no power to replace members before the end of their tenure. Furthermore, the Sports Arbitration Board’s independence was further guaranteed by the fact that it had its own secretariat under its authority and that the financial remuneration of members was set out in law. In any event, unlike the TFF Arbitration Committee, which operated within the general structure of the Football Federation, the Sports Arbitration Board had no ties to any sports federation, not even the TVF. In terms of practical matters, the Sports Arbitration Board had no connection with the appointment and retention of the directors of the TVF and the federation did not contribute to their remuneration.

Sweden, 1 July 1997, § 45, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV; Di Giovanni v. Italy, no. 51160/06, § 52, 9 July 2013; and Bilgen v. Turkey, no. 1571/07, § 73, 9 March 2021) since a tribunal, within the meaning of Article 6 § 1, is characterised, in the substantive sense of the term by its judicial function, that is to say, to determine matters within its competence on the basis of rules of law and after proceedings conducted in a prescribed manner (see Guðmundur Andri Ástráðsson v. Iceland [GC], no. 26374/18, § 219, 1 December 2020). A power of decision is inherent in the very notion of “tribunal”. The procedure before it must ensure the “determination of the merits in dispute” as required by Article 6 § 1 (see Benthem v. the Netherlands, 23 October 1985, § 40, Series A no. 97 and Bilgen, cited above, § 73). In addition, only an institution that has full jurisdiction and satisfies a number of requirements, such as independence from the executive and also from the parties, merits the designation “tribunal” within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention (Guðmundur Andri Ástráðsson, cited above, § 219).", "para_idx": 159}, {"section": "merits", "text": "74.  The concepts of “independence” and “impartiality” are closely linked and, depending on the circumstances, may require joint examination (see Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e Sá v.

The Court has held that “independence” refers to the necessary personal and institutional independence that is required for impartial decision-making, and it is therefore a prerequisite for impartiality. It characterises both the state of mind, which means that a judge cannot be swayed by external pressure as a matter of moral integrity, and a set of institutional and operational arrangements – involving both a procedure by which judges can be appointed in a manner that ensures their independence and selection criteria based on merit – which must provide safeguards against undue influence and/or unfettered discretion of the other State powers, both at the initial stage of the appointment of a judge and during the performance of his or her duties (see Guðmundur Andri Ástráðsson, cited above, § 234). Compliance with this requirement is assessed, in particular, on the basis of statutory criteria, such as the manner of appointment of the members of the tribunal and the duration of their term of office, or the existence of sufficient safeguards against the risk of outside pressures. The question whether the body presents an appearance of independence is also of relevance (see Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e Sá, cited above, § 144; Oleksandr Volkov v. Ukraine, no. 21722/11, § 103, ECHR 2013; and Grace Gatt v.

Provided that the candidates possess the qualifications required by the legislation, the Minister enjoys an unfettered discretion in choosing who will serve on the Sports Arbitration Board. The Court reiterates that the appointment of members of a tribunal by the executive is not, in itself, incompatible with the Convention, as is the election or appointment of judges by the executive or the legislature (see Zolotas v. Greece, no. 38240/02, § 24, 2 June 2005 and Guðmundur Andri Ástráðsson, cited above, § 207). What the Convention requires is that the appointment procedure be free from undue political influence and that, once elected or appointed, members of a tribunal remain independent and free from any pressure in the exercise of their judicial functions (see, for example, Guðmundur Andri Ástráðsson, cited above, § 207; Xero Flor w Polsce sp. z o.o. v.

In the specific context of sports-related disputes and compulsory arbitration proceedings such as the one at issue here, the requirements of independence and absence of undue influence must also be assessed having regard to the particular institutional framework in which the arbitral tribunals operate. In the present case, there is nothing to suggest that the appointment process was tainted by undue political influence. The applicant did not allege that the members of the Sports Arbitration Board had received any inappropriate instructions or had been subjected to pressure from the Ministry when deciding on her case. No such instructions or pressure can be discerned from the case file either (see Ali Rıza and Others, cited above, § 209).

The Court examined the composition of the TFF’s decision-making bodies and observed that the interests of football clubs outweighed those of other parties, as the composition of both the Board of Directors (who appointed the members of the Arbitration Committee) and the Congress (who elected the Board of Directors) consisted mostly of representatives of football clubs. As well as observing that structural imbalance, the Court also observed that, despite the guarantee of the security of tenure of the members of the Arbitration Committee, the fact that their term of office was limited to that of the Board of Directors raised doubts as to their impartiality. The Court also considered whether the members of the Arbitration Committee were adequately protected from outside pressures and identified a number of shortcomings. For example, there were no clear rules of procedure, and there was no body to hear challenges to the members’ independence and impartiality of members. Furthermore, the members were not immune from legal action which might be brought against them in connection with their duties, nor were they bound by any rules of professional conduct or required to swear an oath before taking up their duties (ibid., §§ 212-216).", "para_idx": 166}, {"section": "merits", "text": "81.  Given the similarity of the present case to Ali Rıza and Others (ibid.) since they both concern compulsory dispute resolution mechanisms in the field of sports, the Court will follow the approach set out in that case.", "para_idx": 167}, {"section": "merits", "text": "82.  The Court begins by noting that, unlike the Arbitration Committee, the Sports Arbitration Board has a remit that covers all sports disciplines except football. It is therefore not a body that resolves disputes in a specific field of sports and under the organisational umbrella of a specific sports federation. The undesirable overrepresentation of the interests of clubs or federations in the appointment and functions of the dispute resolution mechanism is simply not in issue here (compare and contrast Ali Rıza and Others, cited above, §§ 210-211). More importantly, the dispute in this case was between the applicant and a private sports federation, rather than between the applicant and the Ministry. If the dispute had been between the applicant and the Ministry, her argument that the arbitrators lacked independence on account of having been appointed by the Minister would carry more weight. It is true that the Minister who appoints the members of the Sports Arbitration Board also appoints representatives to the Congress of the TVF. However, the ratio of Ministry’s representatives within the Congress is not so high as to justify, from an objective point of view, that the Sports Arbitration Board would be biased in a dispute involving the TVF solely because the Minister had appointed members both to a body of a sports federation and to its arbitration board.", "para_idx": 168}, {"section": "merits", "text": "83.  The Court next notes that the term of office of the members of the Arbitration Board is limited to four years during which their tenure is guaranteed by law.

Members have the right to give separate opinions and the procedure to be followed is set out in the regulations. Therefore, Members are not subordinate to the Minister. Although the secretarial services of the Board are provided by the Ministry, the coordinator appointed from the Ministry to organise the administrative work of the Board reports directly to the Board’s chairman and is responsible to him or her. These factors – namely, security of tenure, a fixed term of office, the amount of remuneration set out in legislation; and a lack of subordination to the Ministry, coupled with the Board’s lack of any organisational or structural relationship with the parties to the dispute - are sufficient safeguards to ensure independence and impartiality.", "para_idx": 171}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "86.  That being so, a number of shortcomings observed with respect to the TFF’s Arbitration Committee also appear to affect the Board.

The rules do not specify a body that can hear such a challenge. The fact that the Arbitration Board is exclusively composed of lay assessors does not pose any problem for the Court. However, it notes that members of the Arbitration Board are not immune from legal action in connection with the discharge of their duties and are not bound by any rules of professional conduct. Nor are they required to swear an oath or make a solemn declaration before taking up their duties.

It is moreover necessary to take into account, inter alia, the diversity of the submissions that a litigant may bring before the courts and the differences existing in the Contracting States with regard to statutory provisions, customary rules, legal opinion and the presentation and drafting of judgments. That is why the question whether a court has failed to fulfil the obligation to state reasons, deriving from Article 6 § 1, can only be determined in the light of the circumstances of the case (see Gorou v. Greece (no. 2) [GC], no. 12686/03, § 37, 20 March 2009, with further references).", "para_idx": 178}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "93.  Moreover, the Court has held that the question of whether the extent of the judicial review carried out on an administrative appeal was “sufficient” may depend not only on the discretionary or technical nature of the decision appealed against and the particular issue that the applicant wished to have reviewed but also, more generally, on the nature of the “civil rights and obligations” at stake and the nature of the policy objective pursued by the underlying domestic law (see Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e Sá, cited above, § 180, 6 November 2018).", "para_idx": 179}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "94.  Turning to the present case, the Court notes that the TVF has the sole authority to take decisions in respect of referees as far as the administration and management of volleyball is concerned. Therefore, irrespective of their domestic legal classification and their status in the Contracting State concerned, for the purposes of the present examination and to the extent necessary, they must be treated as an administrative authority. The Court’s case-law on administrative law appeals is therefore relevant to the scope of judicial or quasi-judicial review exercised by the Sports Arbitration Board. Consequently, the guarantees applicable to administrative decision-making and the standards of judicial review under Article 6 § 1 come into play. Accordingly, in relation to administrative law appeals in the Member States of the Council of Europe, it is often the case that the scope of judicial review over the facts of a case is limited, and that review proceedings involve the reviewing authority examining the previous proceedings, rather than taking a decision on the facts. It can be derived from the relevant case-law that it is not the role of Article 6 of the Convention to give access to a level of jurisdiction which can substitute its opinion for that of the administrative authorities (see Sigma Radio Television Ltd v. Cyprus, nos. 32181/04 and 35122/05, § 153, 21 July 2011).", "para_idx": 180}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "95.  The Court has dealt with a number of cases where the court in question did not have full jurisdiction, yet still examined the decision of a decision-making body. In several of those instances, it has found that the judicial review was sufficient and that the proceedings complied with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. That was the outcome where, for example, the applicants’ submissions were examined on their merits or grounds of appeal point by point on judicial review, without the court having to decline jurisdiction in replying to them or in finding various facts (see, among other authorities, Bryan v. the United Kingdom, 22 November 1995, §§ 44-45, Series A no. 335‑A, and Aleksandar Sabev v. Bulgaria, no. 43503/08, § 51, 19 July 2018; see also, mutatis mutandis, Donadzé v.

The Court has therefore found violations of Article 6 § 1 in cases where the domestic courts considered themselves bound by the prior findings of administrative bodies which were decisive for the outcome of the cases before them and did not examine the issues independently (Sigma Radio Television Ltd, cited above, § 157 with further references).", "para_idx": 182}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "97.  Turning to the present case, the Court notes that the question of whether the applicant has had access to a sufficient judicial review of the decision taken against her by the TVF is closely related to the reasoning given by the Sports Arbitration Board when it examined the applicant’s case.

It resulted in the applicant’s exclusion from the list of accredited referees for the periods in question. The discretionary nature of this decision is not in dispute. The issue raised by the applicant was whether the exercise of that discretion had complied with the regulations and principles of administrative law. The Board, merely stated that the TVF had not exceeded its discretion, without explaining in its reasoning how it came to that conclusion. In this context, however, it was essential for the Sports Arbitration Board to ascertain the criteria employed by the TVF in selecting the referees to be included on the list, and to assess, in the light of applicable laws and regulations (in particular section 29 of the Observer and Referee Directive, see paragraph 43 above), whether the exercise of discretion had been arbitrary. Given the brevity of the Board’s reasoning, which contains no indication of the factual and or legal basis for finding that TVF’s discretion complied with the lawfulness criteria, the review conducted cannot be regarded as either sufficient or meaningful for the purposes of Article 6 § 1.", "para_idx": 184}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "99.  In view of the above, the Court concludes that the lack of a reasoned assessment of the applicant’s decisive arguments and the underlying facts, resulting in insufficient judicial review by the Sports Arbitration Board, constituted a violation of her right to a fair trial under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.", "para_idx": 185}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "100.  The applicant complained that the TVF’s decision not to include her on the list of referees or to approve her assignment to the international competitions in question breached her freedom to exercise a professional activity as protected in Article 8 of the Convention, which reads as follows:", "para_idx": 186}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "“1.  Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.", "para_idx": 187}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "2.  There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”", "para_idx": 188}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "101.  The Government asserted that Article 8 was not engaged by the circumstances of the present case.

They claimed that refereeing was not the applicant’s principal professional activity and that Article 8 could not be engaged by secondary activities. There was no contractual relationship between the TVF and the applicant and neither was there a legal provision requiring the TVF to continuously assign her to international competitions. In any event, unlike for example the applicant in the case of Platini v. Switzerland ((dec.), no. 526/18, § 65, 11 February 2020), the applicant had never been suspended nor prevented entirely from exercising her activities as a referee.

In addition to their objections that Article 8 of the Convention was not engaged by the applicant’s complaint, the Government also asserted that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies, as she had not applied to the Sports Arbitration Board for a reconsideration of their decision nor had she lodged a civil compensation claim in the ordinary courts for the alleged loss of opportunity to officiate at the matches in question.

She received an annual income of 5,500-6,000 Swiss francs from these tournaments, and more than 1,000 euros (EUR) for national competitions. She submitted that participating in international competitions had been a very important source of income for her, and that therefore there had been significant negative effects on her private life when the TVF had abruptly stopped assigning her to international competitions.

It also covers the right to personal development and to establish and develop relationships with other human beings and the outside world. In this sense, Article 8 may also extend to professional activities (see Platini, cited above, § 52 with further references).

Hungary (dec.), nos. 45434/12 and 2 others, § 129, 27 November 2018) The Court will only accept that Article 8 is engaged where the alleged breach has had consequences that are very serious and affect the applicant’s private life to a very significant degree (Denisov, cited above, § 116).", "para_idx": 193}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "105.  The Court notes that the applicant was neither disqualified nor demoted, nor was she otherwise prevented from refereeing as a result of the decision not to include her on the list of international referees.

It appears that the number of matches assigned to a referee in a given year may fluctuate or, in some cases, a referee may not be assigned any matches at all despite being on a list. Moreover, in support of her arguments, the applicant only presented financial statements detailing her income from international competitions concerning the years 2015 and 2016. In these circumstances, the Court does not find that the measure directly resulted in the worsening of the applicant’s material well-being to any significant extent.

The courts in the compensation proceedings held the material was protected, based on the general protection of legal privilege under the fair trial provisions of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the analogy with Article 88(1) of the CCP. However, as the Court has already observed (see paragraphs 65-66 above), that analogy was rather tenuous and several other domestic courts and authorities, including the Constitutional Court, did not find a prohibition. The Court therefore finds that it was not sufficiently clear that there was a rule of domestic law prohibiting the inspection of privileged data extracted from a lawyer’s client’s electronic devices and, if there was such a rule, how it was applied.

The actual observations of the CBA were contained in the application to intervene, and the Constitutional Court decided the case, summarising the CBA observations in its judgment, without the applicants having had the opportunity to comment on the CBA’s observations before the delivery of the judgment.

It is clear from the judgment that the Court, following its case-law, may sometimes permit such a third-party intervention without communication of the application for leave to the parties if there are “very weighty reasons” to do so (see paragraph 96 of the judgment). In my view – and this is where my difference with the majority lies – is that the guarantees of equality of arms and adversarial proceedings implicitly enshrined in Article 6 § 1 are indispensable components of a fair hearing, and no exceptions may be made to them, regardless of any purportedly “weighty reasons” a court may invoke to dispense with them (the judgment considers that the right to adversarial proceedings is not absolute – see paragraph 94).", "para_idx": 164}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "5.  Consequently, in my humble view, the present case was correctly decided in its outcome in finding a violation of Article 6 § 1, but its reasoning failed to provide firm protection for the structural guarantees of Article 6 § 1. By leaving open the possibility that non-communication might be acceptable if accompanied by very weighty reasons, the judgment, with all due respect, undermines the normative foundations of adversarial proceedings and equality of arms. The normative, or principled, approach – which I follow – treats non-communication as a violation per se: a defect that cannot be counterbalanced, justified, or absorbed into an “overall fairness” assessment. Only this approach, and not the current case-law approach of the Court – what I refer to as the “qualified overall fairness” approach – preserves the indispensable structural features of a fair trial under the Convention. I have explained the principled or normative view in a number of separate opinions[1], to which I refer, contrasting it with the qualified view of procedural fairness that permits a balancing exercise, and I am thus spared from elaborating further on the differences between these two views. Despite the fact that the judgment does not endorse the normative approach in stating that “very weighty reasons” can exonerate a failure to communicate pleadings of third parties, it does, however, endorse the normative view in paragraph 99 of the judgment regarding some other issues, namely, (a) that it does not need to determine whether the failure to communicate the CBA’s application for permission to intervene prejudiced the applicants; (b) that the extent to which the CBA’s arguments influenced the Constitutional Court’s assessment is not decisive from the point of view of the applicants’ right to a fair hearing; and (c) that the applicants’ opportunity to pro-actively consult the case file, does not mean that the court had no obligation to communicate the CBA’s application to the applicants for comments.", "para_idx": 165}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "6.  A few further points concerning the principled or normative approach require clarification. According to this approach, as I understand it and adhere to it, the overall fairness of a trial encompasses the fulfilment of all Article 6 guarantees, and this applies not only to each stage of the proceedings but also to every participant or stakeholder in the trial, including any interveners. Fairness must be preserved at every moment and among all actors or stakeholders. For example, if an intervener participates in the trial without proper communication, fairness is compromised, even if all other aspects of the procedure were formally in order. In the present case, not only did the Constitutional Court fail to require the CBA to communicate its application for leave to intervene to the applicants, but it also did not give the applicants an opportunity to see or comment on the CBA’s observations, which were included in that very application for leave to intervene.", "para_idx": 166}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "7.  I respectfully disagree with the judgment when it states that the failure to communicate observations that have been accepted and included in the file for consideration of the deciding court can be justified in certain circumstances, in particular, when there are very weighty reasons (see paragraph 96 of the judgment). The judgment relativises what should be, under the principled procedural fairness view, a categorical fairness requirement. The right of an individual to be informed of and to respond to submissions pertinent to their case constitutes a foundational principle underpinning both the adversarial process and the doctrine of equality of arms and the right to effective participation in a trial. This procedural right should not be construed as a mere formal or secondary requirement that that can be traded away or can be subject to derogation at the discretion of domestic authorities.", "para_idx": 167}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "8.  To conceive of the communication of submissions as just a facet of procedure that is susceptible to omission – provided there exists weighty justification – amounts to a recharacterisation of a fundamental procedural guarantee as an optional aspect of domestic procedure. Such an approach is antithetical to the very essence of fairness embedded in the principles of equality of arms and adversarial proceedings, “according to which the parties must have the opportunity not only to be made aware of any evidence needed for their claims to succeed, but also to have knowledge of, and comment on, all evidence adduced or observations filed, with a view to influencing the court’s decision” (see Hudáková and Others v. Slovakia, no. 23083/05, § 26, 27 April 2010). The fair-trial guarantees implicated in this context – specifically, the right to knowledge of supporting submissions and the opportunity to respond – do not constitute interests to be weighed in the balance against other factors or considerations. Rather, they are necessary preconditions for any process to be considered fair within the meaning of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention. Their absence negates the minimum threshold of fairness to which parties are entitled; procedural fairness in this sense is not amenable to a balancing exercise but instead demands the categorical presence of all guarantees.", "para_idx": 168}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "9.  Consequently, the principled and doctrinally sound position is that the failure to communicate an application for leave to intervene as a third party, in the present case that of the CBA, is intrinsically and categorically incompatible with Article 6 § 1.

The absence of knowledge of submissions by a third party, irrespective of the domestic court’s rationale or securing of the rest of the Article 6 guarantees, is in itself a violation of the procedural rights protected by the Convention. To reiterate, the failure to disclose submissions integral to the case undermines the structural principles of adversarial proceedings and equality of arms.", "para_idx": 169}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "10.  A normative or principled view of procedural fairness therefore compels the adoption of a clear and categorical rule: non-communication with respect to relevant submissions constitutes a violation per se of the principles of adversarial proceedings and equality of arms as well as of the principle of effective participation in a trial, regardless of any extenuating circumstances proffered by the domestic court. This approach not only preserves the normative and structural integrity of Article 6 § 1, but also places essential limits upon the doctrine of overall fairness, precluding the reduction of inviolable procedural guarantees to tradeable variables. By recognising non-communication as inherently violative, this position ensures the continued protection of the adversarial process and the principle of equality of arms as indispensable elements of the right to a fair trial.", "para_idx": 170}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "11.  If one rightly considers the principles of equality of arms and adversarial proceedings, as well as the principle of effective participation in a hearing, as categorical and absolute procedural guarantees indispensable for a fair trial, then there can be no legitimate issue of balancing these guarantees against other considerations, such as an alleged need to “conduct proceedings economically [meaning here expediently]” (see paragraph 95 of the judgment). The existence of these guarantees is not contingent upon the presence of countervailing reasons or the overall fairness of the proceedings; rather, their presence is a prerequisite for any process to qualify as a fair trial. In this light, the invocation of reasons such as “conducting proceedings economically” (ibid) cannot be hierarchically elevated above the existence of these guarantees. The principle of equality of arms, as interpreted by the Court, requires that each party be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present their case under conditions that do not place them at a substantial disadvantage vis-à-vis their opponent. Closely connected to this is the principle of effective participation, which demands that individuals not only be present in the proceedings but also be able to understand, engage with, and influence the process in a meaningful way. Effective participation thus presupposes equality of arms: without genuine parity between the parties, participation becomes formal rather than substantive. Similarly, adversarial proceedings demand that parties have knowledge of and the ability to respond to all submissions relevant to their case. This too is a core component of effective participation, for one cannot effectively participate in a process whose essential elements remain undisclosed. These requirements are not subject to exceptions or qualifications based on administrative convenience or efficiency. To permit the omission of communication of pleadings on grounds such as economic efficiency would undermine the very structure of fair trial protections. The categorical nature of these guarantees means that they cannot be traded away or diluted by reference to other procedural objectives.", "para_idx": 171}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "12.  In the present case, there has been a violation not merely of one Article 6 § 1 guarantee, but of four: the principle of equality of arms, the principle of adversarial proceedings, the principle of effective participation in the trial, and the guarantee of a reasoned judgment. The first three guarantees were breached not only because the Constitutional Court failed to give the applicants an opportunity to be informed of, and heard before, the admission of the CBA’s application, but also because it did not allow them to be informed of the CBA’s observations after deciding to accept them, nor to comment on those observations before delivering its final judgment.", "para_idx": 172}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "13.  Fairness is not merely a technical attribute of legal procedure; it represents a moral commitment to equality, transparency, participation, and respect for human dignity. The principled view of fairness, which I adopt, regards fairness as a foundational value rather than a functional instrument, safeguarding both human dignity and the integrity of the rule of law. This perspective underscores that justice turns not only on the substance of the decision reached, but equally on the manner in which that decision is achieved. Procedural fairness, therefore, reflects the deeper truth that the administration of justice must itself be conducted in a just and morally defensible way.", "para_idx": 173}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "14.  In conclusion, the absence of communication and the failure to give the applicants an opportunity to be heard on the third-party intervention constituted, in themselves, a violation of the principles of equality of arms, adversarial proceedings and effective participation in the trial, irrespective of the domestic court’s reasoning, if any (in the present case no reasoning was provided for that omission), or of the broader fairness guarantee. In my humble submission, this normative approach ensures that the integrity of Article 6 § 1 is preserved and that the foundational values of adversarial justice remain non-derogable and structurally safeguarded within the framework of the Convention. It reaffirms that procedural rights are not mere ancillary guarantees, but the very mechanisms through which the rule of law is animated and through which judicial authority acquires its democratic legitimacy. More profoundly, it underscores the doctrinal truth that fairness in procedure is not simply instrumental to a just outcome; it is constitutive of justice itself. When the Court gives full effect to the indispensable guarantees of Article 6, it affirms that legality endures only through fidelity to transparency and parity – without which adjudication loses its claim to do justice.", "para_idx": 174}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "APPENDIX", "para_idx": 175}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "List of cases:", "para_idx": 176}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "No.", "para_idx": 177}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "Application no.", "para_idx": 178}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "Case name", "para_idx": 179}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "Lodged on", "para_idx": 180}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "ApplicantYear of BirthPlace of ResidenceNationality", "para_idx": 181}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "1.", "para_idx": 182}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "37514/20", "para_idx": 183}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "Černý v. the Czech Republic", "para_idx": 184}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "18/08/2020", "para_idx": 185}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "Adam ČERNÝ1979PragueCzech", "para_idx": 186}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "2.", "para_idx": 187}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "37525/20", "para_idx": 188}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "Čapčuch v. the Czech Republic", "para_idx": 189}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "18/08/2020", "para_idx": 190}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "Pavel ČAPČUCH1961BrnoCzech", "para_idx": 191}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "3.", "para_idx": 192}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "37533/20", "para_idx": 193}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "Kočí v. the Czech Republic", "para_idx": 194}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "18/08/2020", "para_idx": 195}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "Petr KOČÍ1979PragueCzech", "para_idx": 196}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "4.", "para_idx": 197}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "37546/20", "para_idx": 198}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "Lichnovský v. the Czech Republic", "para_idx": 199}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "18/08/2020", "para_idx": 200}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "Ondřej LICHNOVSKÝ1980ProstejovCzech", "para_idx": 201}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "5.", "para_idx": 202}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "37555/20", "para_idx": 203}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "Medňanská v. the Czech Republic", "para_idx": 204}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "18/08/2020", "para_idx": 205}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "Ilona MEDŇANSKÁ1987BrnoCzech", "para_idx": 206}, {"section": "separate_opinion", "text": "[1] See Xenofontos and Others, nos. 68725/16 and 2 others, 25 October 2022 (paragraphs 28‑50 of the opinion); Souroullas Kay and Zannettos, no. 1618/18, 26 November 2024 (paragraphs 5-36 of the opinion); Yüksel Yalçınkaya v.

As to the civil limb of Article 6 § 1, although pecuniary effects were involved, the dispute remained fiscal and thus outside the civil limb unless it concerned an ancillary private-law issue, which was not the case (they cited Vegotex International S.A. v. Belgium [GC], no. 49812/09, §§ 66 and 68-75, 3 November 2022). The impugned decision did not determine a private right or resolve a dispute between private parties, but rather placed the addressee, such as the applicant, in an ancillary position to the principal tax debtor to ensure the collection of tax debts.

In domestic classification, the assignment of tax liability was not classified as a criminal or administrative offence; it formed part of the tax-collection framework and pursued guarantee and compensatory aims rather than retribution or general prevention. As to the nature of the offence, the impugned measure did not have punitive features but operated as a civil-law style allocation of pecuniary responsibility triggered by specified statutory conditions of participation in asset-shielding, which distinguished it from the tax surcharges expressly designed to punish and deter non-compliance (they cited in contrast Bendenoun v. France, 24 February 1994, §§ 46-47, Series A no. 284, and Jussila v. Finland [GC], no. 73053/01, §§ 30-38, ECHR 2006-XIV). It also targeted a very specific group, that of insolvency administrators, who had particular responsibilities for the safeguarding of the insolvency estate and the protection of the debtor’s assets. Regarding severity, the Government maintained that the consequences were purely pecuniary and limited to securing payment of an existing public debt, without any addition of a punitive increment, statutory minimum, or tariff typical of criminal sanctions.

He emphasised that the issues examined (knowledge, participation, causation, scope of guarantee) were typical of civil liability and were adjudicated by courts with full jurisdiction over both facts and law. He distinguished this case from Ferrazzini on grounds that the latter concerned the assessment of a taxpayer’s own liability, whereas the present dispute concerned a third party’s personal liability for another’s debt on fault-based criteria, akin to a statutory guarantee or extra-contractual liability. He emphasised that the liability was not grounded in his ability to pay but rather on his allegedly wrongful conduct, demonstrating its non-fiscal character. He referred to the Court’s case-law recognising that, notwithstanding an administrative framework, the civil limb applies where the dispute decisively affects private pecuniary rights (see Mennitto v. Italy [GC], no. 33804/96, § 23, ECHR 2000-X).

Its application was not limited to a specific group with very specific obligations. It applied to any person or entity that caused or collaborated in the concealment or transfer of taxpayers’ assets or rights with the purpose of preventing the action of the tax authorities and was not limited to members of the insolvency administration. The aim or objective of that provision revealed its punitive character, insofar as it targeted the conduct which was similar in content and scope to that described in Article 257 of the Spanish Criminal Code as the criminal offence of asset stripping. Finally, the penalty was sufficiently severe. Even though it was limited to the value of the assets concealed, the amount requested from the person found liable for concealment did not bear any relation to their ability to pay, while the possibility of claiming a refund from the main taxpayer was not practicable in the context of insolvency.

The assignment of liability under Article 42.2(a) of the GTA was predicated on findings that the applicant had caused or collaborated in the concealment or transfer of the taxpayer’s assets with the purpose of impeding the action of the tax authorities.

The applicant further argued that recourse to the patrimonial liability claim imposed an excessive and unreasonable burden on litigants.

It neither annulled the impugned judgment nor ordered the reopening of the proceedings or a fresh judicial determination of the applicant’s liability. Its effect was confined to enabling the applicant to pursue State liability claim under Article 292 of the LOPJ. The Court has previously held that where, as in the present case, the alleged breach concerns the acknowledged divergent findings and allegedly deficient reasoning of a judgment that remains in force, the most appropriate form of redress would be a retrial or the reopening of the case (see Melgarejo Martinez de Abellanosa v. Spain, no. 11200/19, § 48, 14 December 2021).

By contrast, the present complaint does not concern any delay or administrative dysfunction but the fairness and reasoning of the judicial determination itself.

In the present case, two years after the filing of the patrimonial liability claim with the Ministry of Justice, it remains pending without a decision. It does not appear that the Ministry has undertaken any meaningful steps to process the claim, apart from sending a request to another authority for the preparation of a report that was later acknowledged to have been unnecessary (see paragraph 15 above). The Court reiterates that a remedy that functions only with considerable delay cannot be regarded as adequate, as it would fail to provide timely redress and would leave the applicant in a prolonged state of uncertainty (see, mutatis mutandis, Marshall and Others v. Malta, no. 79177/16, § 88, 11 February 2020).", "para_idx": 57}, {"section": "merits", "text": "51.  The Court accordingly dismisses the Government’s preliminary objections concerning the applicant’s victim status and the alleged non‑exhaustion of domestic remedies.", "para_idx": 58}, {"section": "merits", "text": "52.  The Court finds that the application is neither manifestly ill-founded nor inadmissible on any other grounds listed in Article 35 of the Convention.

The Court acknowledges that the possibility of conflicting court decisions is an inherent trait of any judicial system and cannot, in itself, be considered contrary to the Convention. However, divergent decisions by domestic courts based on identical facts may run counter to the principle of legal certainty and could even amount to a denial of justice (see Melgarejo Martinez de Abellanosa, cited above, §§ 30 and 34, and Inmobilizados y Gestiones S.L. v. Spain, no. 79530/17, §§ 40-41, 14 September 2021).", "para_idx": 62}, {"section": "merits", "text": "56.  The Court observes that the judgments at issue were delivered by the same Chamber of the Audiencia Nacional within a relatively short period of time, concerning the same legal question and factual background.

The three contradictory judgments (one dismissing and two upholding appeals based on the same reasoning) reveal a manifest inconsistency in the assessment of relevant facts and legal arguments by the same Section of the Audiencia Nacional.

In the present case, the Audiencia Nacional failed to address the applicant’s central submission concerning the validity of payments to REEF, which was potentially determinative of the scope of his liability.

The Court further notes that any eventual outcome of the applicant’s pending claim for State liability before the Ministry of Justice is also directly relevant to the assessment of the quantum of damages in the present case. In view of the uncertainties inherent in quantifying the pecuniary damage, the Court finds that the question of the application of Article 41 in respect of pecuniary damage is not ready for decision.

Without requiring a detailed answer to every argument, this obligation presupposes that a party to judicial proceedings can expect a specific and express reply to those submissions which are decisive for the outcome of the proceedings in question (see Ramos Nunes de Carvalho e Sá v.

Germany (dec.), no. 15073/03, 13 February 2007). The Court recalls in this respect that the right to a reasoned decision serves the general rule enshrined in the Convention which protects the individual from arbitrariness by demonstrating to the parties that they have been heard, receive a response to their submissions and understand a judicial decision (Baydar, cited above, § 39, and Harisch, cited above, § 33). Taking further into account that there is no right to have a question referred for a preliminary ruling (see paragraph 35 above), a party can, as a safeguard against arbitrariness, only expect a response by a national court in the reasons of a judgement or decision if that party has made submissions for a referral before the competent national court. In the absence of such a request and explicit reasons the Court considers that the fact that a court, without providing reasons, did not refer a question to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling could not be regarded as infringing the fairness of the proceedings pursuant to Article 6 of the Convention (see Somorjai, cited above, §§ 60, John (dec.), cited above; and SOL.IN.MUS.

As regards the applicant’s request for a preliminary ruling before the CJEU, the Federal Court of Justice stated that “(it) has also examined the question of an obligation to refer the matter to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling under Article 267 § 3 TFEU” (see paragraph 12 above).", "para_idx": 82}, {"section": "merits", "text": "44.  The Court recognises, as pointed out by the Government (see paragraph 33 above), the strain which high case numbers put on supreme courts and the challenges of balancing the need to speed up proceedings, concentrate on core functions and provide reasons for decisions.

In the context of a complaint against the refusal to grant leave to appeal which include a request for referral to the CJEU, such as in the present case, the Court considers that, under Article 6 of the Convention and in the light of the requirement of procedural fairness, a refusal, while not necessarily needing to be more detailed, must at least indicate the CILFIT criteria on which it was based.

France, nos. 48151/11 and 77769/13, § 93, 18 January 2018). It has held, in the context of a religious institution, that the absence of formal legal personality status under domestic law does not prevent an entity from acting as an applicant, where its rights and capacity to take legal action in its own name have been recognised by the domestic authorities, including the courts (see Chief Rabbinate of the Jewish Community of İzmir v.

Bulgaria (just satisfaction), nos. 412/03 and 35677/04, §§ 34-35, 16 September 2010). Similar logic can be applied in the present case. The Court notes that the applicant movement known as the Navalnyy Headquarters, although not formally registered as a legal entity, existed as a structured and coordinated network with a recognised leadership and common political aims (see paragraph 7 above). The domestic courts themselves acknowledged that the Navalnyy Headquarters was a public association operating without State registration or the acquisition of legal-entity status; it was headed by Mr Volkov, had offices in thirty-seven regions and functioned as an interregional association. They further referred to it in the extremism proceedings as a component part of the “extremist organisations” led by Mr Navalnyy and treated it as such in the measures prohibiting its activities (see paragraphs 34-35 above). Accordingly, the Court considers that the movement had a de facto existence and was directly affected by the impugned measures.

Russia [GC], no. 47143/06, §§ 228-30, 4 December 2015). In the context of searches and seizures, domestic law must afford individuals adequate protection against arbitrary interference with their rights under Article 8.

The majority of searches in the present case were formally authorised by the Basmannyy District Court of Moscow with the stated aim of uncovering criminal evidence. However, those authorisations were issued on the basis of standard-form investigator’s applications reiterating the general allegations of money laundering against “persons affiliated with the FBK” and merely asserting that relevant items might be found at the applicants’ premises owing to their connection to Mr Navalnyy (see paragraph 25 above).

Russia, nos. 11264/04 and 15 others, § 127, 4 February 2020).

In the present case, the investigators justified the use of that procedure by referring in general terms to a risk of destruction or concealment of evidence after the initiation of the investigation (see paragraph 27 above). However, the majority of urgent searches were conducted on 15 October 2019, more than two months after the criminal proceedings had been opened, and over a month after the mass searches of 12 September 2019, when numerous investigative measures had already been carried out.

Moreover, as in Taganrog LRO and Others (cited above, § 159), the judicial review of the impugned measures did not provide adequate and effective safeguards against an excessively broad interpretation of the concept of “extremism”, resulting in the automatic and overly rigid application of the legislative framework.", "para_idx": 212}, {"section": "merits", "text": "129.  The Court further notes that the consequences of the designation as “extremist” extended far beyond the dissolution of the FBK and the FZPG and the prohibition of the Navalnyy Headquarters network.

Russia, no. 75186/12, 10 November 2020; Navalnyy v. Russia (no. 2), no. 43734/14, 9 April 2019; Navalnyy and Ofitserov v. Russia, nos. 46632/13 and 28671/14, 23 February 2016; Navalnyye v.

Most residential searches occurred on two dates, 12 September and 15 October 2019, in various regions across the country, indicating a centrally coordinated operation against the background of the summer 2019 protests (see paragraphs 15 and 24 above). The issuing of freezing orders unfolded in two distinct waves: an initial surge in September to October 2019, coinciding with the searches, and a second in February 2020 (see paragraph 18 above). The measures in question were exceptionally broad in both personal and financial scope, extending to a wide circle of persons and entities linked to Mr Navalnyy, including his close family members, and covering accounts in nearly every major Russian bank (see the appendix). The scale, timing and targeting of these actions also suggest that they were not prompted by any genuine investigative need but formed part of a concerted campaign extending far beyond the remit of an ordinary criminal investigation (see, mutatis mutandis, Mammadli v. Azerbaijan, no. 47145/14, § 102, 19 April 2018, and Kavala v.

Those measures were of particular gravity given their broad impact not only on the applicants themselves, but also on the wider community of political activists and supporters associated with Mr Navalnyy (see Navalnyy [GC], cited above, §§ 172-75, and mutatis mutandis, Natig Jafarov v. Azerbaijan, no. 64581/16, § 69, 7 November 2019). The designation of the FBK, the FZPG and the Navalnyy Headquarters as “extremist” had particularly far-reaching consequences: it led to the liquidation of the registered organisations, the criminalisation of any further activity under their auspices, and the exposure of former members and supporters to prosecution and imprisonment. Taken together, those measures dismantled the organisational framework of Mr Navalnyy’s movement, excluded its members from political life, and sent a clear warning to anyone who might seek to engage in opposition activity. Their combined effect was to paralyse the applicants’ legitimate activities in the fields of political expression and civic participation, thereby striking at the heart of pluralistic democracy (see Navalnyy [GC], cited above, § 174, as well as Selahattin Demirtaş v.

In recent years, the political system in Russia has undergone a profound transformation, marked by the progressive dismantling of independent institutions, the suppression of dissenting voices and the erosion of fundamental democratic safeguards, further aggravated by the full-scale military aggression against Ukraine in February 2022. The Court has taken note in its recent judgments of this general trend, observing that the authorities have increasingly restricted the functioning of democratic institutions and political opposition, have gradually eliminated the remaining structures of civil society, and have imposed far-reaching limitations on freedom of expression (see, among other authorities, Ukraine and the Netherlands v.

Russia (re Crimea) [GC], nos. 20958/14 and 38334/18, 25 June 2024; Google LLC and Others v. Russia, no. 37027/22, 8 July 2025; Selishcheva and Others v.

In its Resolution 2540 (2024) the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe described the Russian Federation as having gradually transformed into a State which barred the existence of any political opposition (see paragraph 47 above). Similarly, the European Parliament, in its resolution of 7 April 2022 on the increasing repression in Russia, condemned the use of legislation on “foreign agents” and “extremist organisations” as tools of political control, viewing the repression against Mr Navalnyy, his supporters, the media and civil society as part of a wider campaign to silence dissenting voices in the country (see paragraph 48 above). The European Union in its statement of 10 June 2021 denounced the Moscow City Court’s ruling designating Mr Navalnyy’s organisations as “extremist”, describing it as an unfounded decision indicative of a systematic crackdown on human rights and aimed at eliminating independent political opposition (see paragraph 49 above).", "para_idx": 232}, {"section": "merits", "text": "147.  The Court observes that the official reasons advanced by the authorities, namely the fight against money laundering and extremism, were not supported by any evidence of genuine criminal conduct and instead served as a pretext for dismantling independent political and civic structures. Having regard to the cumulative pattern of measures – the coordinated mass searches and freezing of bank accounts, the FBK’s listing as a “foreign agent”, the dissolution and criminalisation of the applicant organisations through their designation as “extremist”, and the broader context of the progressive suppression of political pluralism in Russia – the Court considers that the authorities’ actions were not applied for any purpose prescribed by the Convention. They formed part of a concerted effort on an unprecedented scale to strike at the heart of and eliminate the organised democratic opposition centred around Mr Navalnyy and therefore pursued an ulterior purpose within the meaning of Article 18 of the Convention.", "para_idx": 233}, {"section": "merits", "text": "148.  There has accordingly been a violation of Article 18 taken in conjunction with Articles 8 and 11 of the Convention and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.", "para_idx": 234}, {"section": "merits", "text": "149.  The majority of the applicants further complained that the mass searches of their homes and offices, the seizure of their personal belongings and the freezing of their bank accounts also infringed their rights under Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.

It notes that that the applicants sustained pecuniary losses as a result of unlawful interferences with their rights under Articles 8 of the Convention, on account of the seizure of their property, and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, concerning the freezing of the bank accounts of the FBK and Mr Zamyatin and the subsequent confiscation of the FBK’s funds.", "para_idx": 244}, {"section": "article_46", "text": "155.  The Court notes that, under Rule 60 of the Rules of Court, any claim for just satisfaction must be itemised and submitted together with the relevant supporting documents or vouchers, failing which the Court may reject the claim in whole or in part.

As regards Mr Zamyatin and Mr Kolesnikov, who submitted documents confirming the sums in question, the Court notes that they were not permanently deprived of their assets but were merely prevented from using them for a certain period. It would therefore be speculative to calculate the exact pecuniary loss sustained by them. However, the Court considers that the violations found resulted in a permanent loss of funds and serious disruption to the FBK’s activities and caused Mr Zamyatin and Mr Kolesnikov distress and frustration arising from their inability to dispose of their seized property (see East West Alliance Limited v. Ukraine, no. 19336/04, §§ 254-65, 23 January 2014).
